<h2>I</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>orth</span> of the Strand, east of the National Gallery,
a narrow street winds a devious course
towards Long Acre. To the casual eye it is no more
than a mean and dingy thoroughfare without charm or
interest, but for the connoisseur it has its legend. Here
Swinburne came upon his famous copy of “The Faerie
Queene”; here more than one collection has been enriched
by a Crome, a Morland, a choice miniature, a
first proof or some rare unsuspected article of bigotry
and virtue.</p>

<p>On the right, going from Charing Cross, halfway
up the street, a shop, outwardly inconspicuous, bears
on its front in plain gilt letters the name S. Gedge,
Antiques.</p>

<p>A regard for the <i>mot juste</i> could omit the final
letter. S. Gedge Antique was nearer the fact. To
look at, the proprietor of the business was an antique
of the most genuine kind, whose age, before he
was dressed for the day, might have been anything.
When, however, he had “tidied himself up” to sit at
the receipt of a custom, a process involving a shave, the
putting on of collar and dickey, prehistoric frock coat,
new perhaps for the Prince Consort’s funeral, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
pair of jemimas that also were “of the period,” his
years, in spite of a yellow parchment countenance of
an incredible cunning, could at conservative estimate
be reckoned as seventy.</p>

<p>On a certain morning of September, the years of the
proprietor of S. Gedge Antiques, whatever they might
be, sat heavily upon him. Tall, sombre, gaunt, a cross
between a hop-pole and a moulting vulture, his tattered
dressing gown and chessboard slippers lent a touch of
fantasy to his look of eld, while the collar and dickey
of commerce still adorned the back kitchen dresser.</p>

<p>Philosophers say that to find a reason for everything
is only a question of looking. The reason for the undress
of S. Gedge Antiques so late as eleven o’clock in
the morning was not far to seek. His right hand man
and sole assistant, who answered to the name of
William, and who was never known or called by any
other, had been away for an annual holiday of one
week, which this year he had spent in Suffolk. He was
due back in the course of that day and his master
would raise a pæan on his return. In the absence of
William the indispensable S. Gedge Antiques was like
a windjammer on a lee shore.</p>

<p>There was a further reason for his lost air. He
was “at outs” with Mrs. Runciman, his charwoman, a
state of affairs which had long threatened to become
chronic. An old, and in her own opinion, an undervalued
retainer, the suspension of diplomatic relations
between Mrs. Runciman and her employer could
always be traced to one cause. S. Gedge attributed it
to the phases of the moon and their effect on the human
female, but the real root of the mischief was Mrs.
Runciman’s demand for “a raise in her celery.” For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
many years past the lady had held that her services
were worth more than “half a crown a day and her
grub.” The invariable reply of her master was that
he had never paid more to a char all the time he had
been in trade and that if she wanted more she could
keep away. This Thursday morning, according to
precedent when matters came to a head, Mrs. Runciman
had taken him at his word. The old man knew,
however, that her absence would only be temporary.
A single day off would vindicate the rights of woman.
As sure as the sun rose on the morrow Mrs. R. would
return impenitent but in better fettle for charring. But
as he made a point of telling her, she would play the
trick once too often.</p>

<p>Char-less for the time being, assistant-less also, this
morning S. Gedge was not only looking his age, he
was feeling it; but he had already begun to examine
the contents of a large packing case from Ipswich
which Messrs. Carter Paterson had delivered half an
hour ago at the back of the premises by the side entry.
Handicapped as S. Gedge Antiques at the moment was,
he could well have deferred these labours until later
in the day. Human curiosity, however, had claimed
him as a victim.</p>

<p>By a side wind he had heard of a sale at a small and
rather inaccessible house in the country where a few
things might be going cheap. As this was to take place
in the course of William’s holiday, the young man had
been given a few pounds to invest, provided that in his
opinion “the goods were full value.” By trusting
William to carry out an operation of such delicacy, his
master whose name in trade circles was that of “a very
keen buyer” was really paying him the highest compliment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
in his power. For the god of S. Gedge Antiques
was money. In the art of “picking things up,” however,
William had a lucky touch. His master could
depend as a rule on turning over a few shillings on each
of the young man’s purchases; indeed there were occasions
when the few shillings had been many. The
truth was that William’s flair for a good thing was
almost uncanny.</p>

<p>Adroit use of a screwdriver prised the lid off the
packing case. A top layer of shavings was removed.
With the air of a <i>dévot</i> the old man dug out William’s
first purchase and held it up to the light of New Cross
Street, or to as much of that dubious commodity as
could filter down the side entry.</p>

<p>Purchase the first proved to be a copy of an engraving
by P. Bartolozzi: the <i>Mrs. Lumley and Her Children</i>
of Sir Joshua Reynolds. An expert eye priced it
at once a safe thirty shillings in the window of the
front shop, although William had been told not to exceed
a third of that sum at Loseby Grange, Saxmundham.
So far so good. With a feeling of satisfaction
S. Gedge laid the engraving upon a chair of ornate appearance
but doubtful authenticity, and proceeded to
remove more straw from the packing case. Before,
however, he could deal with William’s second purchase,
whatever it might be, he was interrupted.</p>

<p>A voice came from the front shop.</p>

<p>“Uncle Si! Uncle Si! Where are you?”</p>

<p>The voice was feminine. S. Gedge Antiques, crusted
bachelor and confirmed hater of women, felt a sudden
pang of dismay.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Uncle Si?”</p>

<p>“Com-ming!” A low roar boomed from the interior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
of the packing case. It failed, however, to get beyond
the door of the lumber room.</p>

<p>“That girl of Abe’s” ruminated the old man deep in
straw. In the stress of affairs, he had almost forgotten
that the only child of a half brother many years his
junior, was coming to London by the morning train.</p>

<p>“Uncle Si!”</p>

<p>With a hiss of disgust worthy of an elderly cobra he
writhed his head free of the straw. “Confound her,
turning up like this. Why couldn’t she come this afternoon
when the boy’d be home? But that’s a woman.
They’re born as cross as Christmas.”</p>

<p>A third time his name was called.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques, unshaven, beslippered, bespectacled,
slowly emerged from the decent obscurity of
the back premises into the fierce publicity of the front
shop. He was greeted by a sight of which his every
instinct profoundly disapproved.</p>

<p>The sight was youthful, smiling, fresh complexioned.
In a weak moment, for which mentally he had been
kicking himself round the shop ever since, he had been
so unwise as to offer to adopt this girl who had lost
her father some years ago and had lately buried her
mother. Carter Paterson had delivered her trunk
along with the packing case from Ipswich, a fact he
now recalled.</p>

<p>Had S. Gedge had an eye for anything but antiques,
he must have seen at once that his niece was by way
of being a decidedly attractive young woman. She
was nineteen, and she wore a neat well-fitting black
dress and a plain black hat in which cunning and good
taste were mingled. Inclined to be tall she was slender
and straight and carried herself well. Her eyes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
clear, shrewd and smiling. In fact they appeared to
smile quite considerably at the slow emergence from
the back premises of S. Gedge Antiques.</p>

<p>In the girl’s hand was a pilgrim basket, which she
put carefully on a gate-legged table, marked “£4.19.6,
a great bargain” and then very fearlessly embraced its
owner.</p>

<p>“How are you, niece?” gasped the old man who felt
that an affront had been offered to the dignity of the
human male.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Uncle Si, I’m first rate,” said the girl
trying for the sake of good manners not to smile too
broadly.</p>

<p>“Had a comfortable journey?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t expect you so soon. However, your box
has come. By the way, what’s your name? I’ve
forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“June.”</p>

<p>“June, eh? One of these new fangled affairs,” S.
Gedge spoke aggrievedly. “Why not call yourself
December and have done with it?”</p>

<p>“I will if you like,” said June obligingly. “But it
seems rather long. Do you care for De, Cem, or Ber
for short?”</p>

<p>“It don’t matter. What’s in a name? I only thought
it sounded a bit sloppy and new fangled.”</p>

<p>The eyes of June continued to regard S. Gedge Antiques
with a demure smile. He did not see the smile.
He only saw her and she was a matter for grave
reflection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S.</span> Gedge Antiques</span> peered dubiously at his
niece. He had a dislike of women and more
than any other kind he disliked young women. But
one fact was already clear; he had let himself in for
it. Frowning at this bitter thought he cast his mind
back in search of a reason. Knowing himself so well
he was sure that a reason there must be and a good one
for so grave an indiscretion. Suddenly he remembered
the charwoman and his brow cleared a little.</p>

<p>“Let me have a look at you, niece.” As a hawk
might gaze at a wren he gazed at June through his
spectacles. “Tall and strong seemingly. I hope you’re
not afraid of hard work.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of anything, Uncle Si,” said June
with calm precision.</p>

<p>“No answers,” said S. Gedge curtly. “If you intend
to stay here you’ve got to mind your p’s and q’s and
you’ve got to earn your keep.” He sighed and impatiently
plucked the spectacles from his nose. “Thought
so,” he snarled. “I’m looking at you with my selling
spectacles. For this job I’ll need my buying ones.”</p>

<p>Delving into the capacious pockets of his dressing
gown, the old man was able to produce a second pair
of glasses. He adjusted them grimly. “Now I can
begin to see you. Favour your father seemingly. And
he was never a mucher&mdash;wasn’t your father.”</p>

<p>“Dad is dead, Uncle Si.” There was reproof in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
June’s strong voice. “And he was a very good man.
There was never a better father than Dad.”</p>

<p>“Must have been a good man. He hardly left you
and your mother the price of his funeral.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Dad’s fault that he was unlucky in business.”</p>

<p>“Unlucky.” S. Gedge Antiques gave a sharp tilt to
his “buying” spectacles. “I don’t believe in luck
myself.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” said June, with a touch of defiance.</p>

<p>“No answers.” Uncle Si held up a finger of warning.
“Your luck is you’re not afraid of work. If
you stop here you’ll have to stir yourself.”</p>

<p>June confessed a modest willingness to do her best.</p>

<p>S. Gedge continued to gaze at her. It was clear that
he had undertaken an immense responsibility. A live
sharp girl, nineteen years of age, one of these modern
hussies, with opinions of her own, was going to alter
things. It was no use burking the fact, but a wise man
would have looked it in the face a little sooner.</p>

<p>“The char is taking a day off,” he said, breaking this
reverie. “So I’d better give you a hand with your box.
You can then change your frock and come and tidy up.
If you give your mind to your job I daresay I’ll be
able to do without the char altogether. The woman’s
a nuisance, as all women are. But she’s the worst kind
of a nuisance, and I’ve been trying to be quit of her
any time this ten years.”</p>

<p>In silence June followed Uncle Si kitchenwards,
slowly removing a pair of black kid gloves as she did
so. He helped her to carry a trunk containing all her
worldly possessions up a steep, narrow, twisty flight of
uncarpeted stairs to a tiny attic, divided by a wooden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
partition from a larger one, and lit by a grimy window
in the roof. It was provided with a bedstead, a mattress,
a chest of drawers, a washing stand and a crazy
looking-glass.</p>

<p>“When the boy comes, he’ll find you a couple o’
blankets, I daresay. Meantime you can fall to as soon
as you like.”</p>

<p>June lost no time in unpacking. She then exchanged
her new mourning for an old dress in which to begin
work. As she did so her depression was terrible. The
death of her mother, a month ago, had meant the loss
of everything she valued in the world. There was no
one else, no other thing that mattered. But she had
promised that she would be a brave girl and face life
with a stout heart, and she was going to be as good
as her word.</p>

<p>For that reason she did not allow herself to spend
much time over the changing of her dress. She would
have liked to sit on the edge of the small bed in that
dismal room and weep. The future was an abyss.
Her prospects were nil. She had ambition, but she
lacked the kind of education and training that could
get her out of the rut; and all the money she had in
the world, something less than twenty pounds, was in
her purse in a roll of notes, together with a few odd
shillings and coppers. Nothing more remained of the
sum that had been realized by the sale of her home,
which her mother and she had striven so hard to keep
together. And when this was gone she would have
to live on the charity of her Uncle Si, who was said to
be a very hard man and for whom she had already conceived
an odd dislike, or go out and find something
to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Such an outlook was grim. But as June put on an
old house frock she shut her lips tight and determined
not to think about to-morrow. Uncle Si had told her
to clean out the grate in the back kitchen. She flattered
herself that she could clean out a grate with anybody.
Merely to stop the cruel ache at the back of her brain
she would just think of her task, and nothing else.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes June came down the attic
stairs, fully equipped even to an overall which she had
been undecided whether to pack in her box but had
prudently done so.</p>

<p>“Where are the brushes and dust pan, Uncle Si?”</p>

<p>“In the cupboard under the scullery sink.” A growl
emerged from the packing case, followed by a gargoyle
head. “And when you are through with the kitchen
grate you can come and clear up this litter, and then
you can cook a few potatoes for dinner&mdash;that’s if you
know how.”</p>

<p>“Of course I know how,” said June.</p>

<p>“Your mother seems to have brought you up properly.
If you give your mind to your job and you’re
not above soiling your hands I quite expect we’ll be
able to do without the char.”</p>

<p>June, her large eyes fixed on Uncle Si, did not flinch
from the prospect. She went boldly, head high, in the
direction of the scullery sink while S. Gedge Antiques
proceeded to burrow deeper and deeper into the packing
case.</p>

<p>Presently he dug out a bowl of Lowestoft china,
which he tapped with a finger nail and held up to the
light.</p>

<p>“It’s a good piece,” he reflected. “There’s one thing
to be said for that boy&mdash;he don’t often make mistakes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
I wonder what he paid for this. However, I shall
know presently,” and S. Gedge placed the bowl on a
chair opposite the engraving “after” P. Bartolozzi.</p>

<p>His researches continued, but there was not much to
follow. Still, that was to be expected. William had
only been given twenty pounds and the bowl alone was
a safe fiver. The old man was rather sorry that William
had not been given more to invest. However,
there was a copper coal-scuttle that might be polished
up to fetch three pounds, and a set of fire irons and
other odds and ends, not of much account in themselves,
but all going to show that good use had been made of
the money.</p>

<p>“Niece,” called Uncle Si when at last the packing
case was empty, “come and give a hand here.”</p>

<p>With bright and prompt efficiency June helped to
clear up the débris and to haul the packing case into
the backyard.</p>

<p>The old man said at the successful conclusion of
these operations:</p>

<p>“Now see what you can do with those potatoes. Boil
’em in their skins. There’s less waste that way and
there’s more flavour.”</p>

<p>“What time is dinner, Uncle Si?”</p>

<p>“One o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques, having put on his collar, and
discarded his dressing gown for the frock coat of
commerce, shambled forward into the front shop with
the air of a man who has no time to waste upon
trivialities. So far things were all right. The girl
seemed willing and capable and he hoped she would
continue to be respectful. The times were against it,
certainly. In the present era of short skirts, open-work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
stockings, fancy shoes and bare necks, it was hard,
even for experts like himself, to say what the world
was coming to. Girls of the new generation were terribly
independent. They would sauce you as soon as
look at you, and there was no doubt they knew far
more than their grandmothers. In taking under his
roof the only child of a half-brother who had died
worth precious little, S. Gedge Antiques was simply
asking for trouble. At the same time there was no
need to deny that June had begun well, and if at eight
o’clock the next morning he was in a position to say,
“Mrs. R. you can take another day off and get yourself
a better billet,” he would feel a happier man.</p>

<p>A voice with a ring in it came from the shop threshold.
“Uncle Si, how many potatoes shall I cook?”</p>

<p>“Three middling size. One for me, one for you,
one for William if he comes. And if he don’t come,
he can have it cold for his supper.”</p>

<p>“Or I can fry it,” said the voice from the threshold.</p>

<p>“You can fry it?” S. Gedge peered towards the
voice over the top of his “buying” spectacles. “Before
we go in for fancy work let us see what sort of a job
you make of a plain bilin’. Pigs mustn’t begin to fly
too early&mdash;not in the West Central postal district.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about pigs,” said June, calmly,
“but I’ll boil a potato with anyone.”</p>

<p>“And eat one too I expect,” said S. Gedge severely
closuring the incident.</p>

<p>The axiom he had just laid down applied to young
female pigs particularly.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S.</span> Gedge Antiques</span>, feather duster in hand,
began to flick pensively a number of articles of
bigotry and virtue. The occupation amused him. It
was not that he had any great regard for the things he
sold, but each was registered in his mind as having
been bought for so much at So-and-So’s sale. A thoroughly
competent man he understood his trade. He
had first set up in business in the year 1879. That was
a long time ago, but it was his proud boast that he had
yet to make his first serious mistake. Like everyone
else, he had made mistakes, but it pleased him to think
that he had never been badly “let in.” His simple rule
was not to pay a high price for anything. Sometimes
he missed a bargain by not taking chances, but banking
on certainties brought peace of mind and a steady
growth of capital.</p>

<p>Perhaps the worst shot he had ever made was the
queer article to which he now applied the duster. A
huge black jar, about six feet high and so fantastically
hideous in design as to suggest the familiar of a Caribbean
witch doctor or the joss of a barbarous king, held
a position of sufficient prominence on the shop floor
for his folly to be ever before him. Years ago he had
taken this grinning, wide-mouthed monster, shaped
and featured like Moloch, in exchange for a bad debt,
hoping that in the course of time he would be able to
trade it away. As yet he had not succeeded. Few people
apparently had a use for such an evil-looking thing
which took up so much house room. S. Gedge Antiques<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
was loth to write it off a dead loss, but he had
now come to regard it as “a hoodoo.” He was not a
superstitious man but he declared it brought bad luck.
On several occasions when a chance seemed to arise
of parting with it to advantage, something had happened
to the intending purchaser; indeed it would have
called for no great effort of the imagination to believe
that a curse was upon it.</p>

<p>By an association of ideas, as the feathers flicked
that surface of black lacquer, the mind of S. Gedge
reverted to his niece. She, too, was a speculation, a
leap in the dark. You never knew where you were
with women. Now that the fools in Parliament had
given females a vote the whole sex was demoralised.
He had been terribly rash; and he could tell by the
look of the girl that she had a large appetite. Still if
he could do without “that woman” it would be something.</p>

<p>The picture, however, was not all dark. A flick of
the feathers emphasised its brighter side as William recurred
suddenly to his mind. Taking all things into
account, he was ready to own that the able youth was
the best bargain he had ever made. Some years ago,
William, a needy lad of unknown origin, had been engaged
at a very small wage to run errands and to make
himself of general use. Finding him extremely intelligent
and possessed of real aptitude, his master with an
eye to the future, had taught him the trade. And he
had now become so knowledgeable that for some little
time past he had been promoted to an active part in the
business.</p>

<p>If William had a fault it was that in his master’s
opinion he was almost too honest. Had it been humanly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
possible for S. Gedge Antiques to trust any man
with a thousand pounds, William undoubtedly would
have been that man. Besides, he had grown so expert
that his employer was learning to rely more and more
upon his judgment. The time had come when S. Gedge
Antiques had need of young eyes in the most delicate
art of choosing the right thing to buy; and this absolutely
dependable young man had now taken rank in
his master’s mind, perhaps in a higher degree than that
master recognised, as an asset of priceless value.
Sooner or later, if William went on in his present way,
the long-deferred rise in his wages would have to enter
the region of practical politics. For example, there
was this packing case from Ipswich. Without indulgence
in flagrant optimism&mdash;and the old man was seldom
guilty of that&mdash;there was a clear profit already in
sight. The bowl of Lowestoft might fetch anything
up to ten pounds and even then it would be “a great
bargain at clearance sale prices.” Then there was the
engraving. William had a nose for such things; indeed
his master often wondered how a young chap with no
education to speak of could have come by it.</p>

<p>At this point there was heard a quiet and respectful:
“Good morning, sir.”</p>

<p>S. Gedge, standing with his back to the shop door,
the china bowl again in hand, was taken by surprise.
William was not expected before the afternoon.</p>

<p>That young man was rather tall and rather slight;
he was decidedly brown from the sun of East Anglia;
and some people might have considered him handsome.
In his left hand he carried a small gladstone bag. And
beneath his right arm was an article wrapped in brown
paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, that’s the bowl,” said William eagerly. “A nice
piece, sir, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I may be able to tell you more about that,” the
cautious answer, “when I know what you gave for it.”</p>

<p>William had given thirty shillings.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques tapped the bowl appraisingly.
“Thirty shillings! But that’s money.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’s a good piece, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may be right,” said S. Gedge grudgingly.
“Lowestoft is fetching fair prices just now.
What’s that under your arm?”</p>

<p>“It’s something I’ve bought for myself, sir.”</p>

<p>“Out of the money I gave you?” said the old man
as keen as a goshawk.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said William with great simplicity. “Your
money was all in the packing case. I’ll give you an
account of every penny.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the thing you’ve bought for yourself,”
said the master sternly.</p>

<p>“It’s a small picture I happened to come across in
an old shop at Crowdham Market.”</p>

<p>“Picture, eh?” S. Gedge Antiques dubiously
scratched a scrub of whisker with the nail of his forefinger.
“Don’t fancy pictures myself. Chancey things
are pictures. Never brought <i>me</i> much luck. However,
I’ll have a look at it. Take off the paper.”</p>

<p>William took off the paper and handed to his master
the article it had contained. With a frown of petulant
disgust the old man held an ancient and dilapidated
daub up to the light. So black it was with grime and
age that to his failing eyes not so much as a hint of the
subject was visible.</p>

<p>“Nothing to write home about anyhow,” was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
sour comment. “Worth nothing beyond the price of
the frame. And I should put that”&mdash;S. Gedge pursed
a mouth of professional knowledge&mdash;“at five shillings.”</p>

<p>“Five shillings, sir, is what I paid for it.”</p>

<p>“Not worth bringing home.” S. Gedge shook a
dour head. Somehow he resented his assistant making
a private purchase, but that may have been because
there was nothing in the purchase when made. “Why
buy a thing like that?”</p>

<p>William took the picture gravely from his master
and held it near the window.</p>

<p>“I have an idea, sir, there may be a subject underneath.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe in ideas myself,” snapped S. Gedge,
taking a microscope from the counter. After a brief
use of it he added, “There may be a bit o’ badly painted
still life, but what’s the good o’ that.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a feeling, sir, there’s something below it.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish anyhow. It’ll be a fortnight’s job to get
the top off and then like as not you’ll have wasted your
time. Why buy a pig in a poke when you might have
invested your five shillings in a bit more china? However,
it’s no affair of mine.”</p>

<p>“There’s something there, sir, under those flowers,
I feel sure,” said the young man taking up the microscope
and gazing earnestly at the picture. “But what
it is I can’t say.”</p>

<p>“Nor can anyone else. However, as I say, it’s your
funeral. In our trade there’s such a thing as being too
speculative, and don’t forget it, boy.”</p>

<p>“I might find a thing worth having, sir,” William
ventured to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Pigs might fly,” snapped S. Gedge Antiques, his
favourite formula for clinching an argument.</p>

<p>The mention of pigs, no doubt again by an association
of ideas, enabled S. Gedge to notice, which he
might have done any time for two minutes past, that
his niece had emerged from the back premises, and
that she was regarding William and the picture with
frank curiosity.</p>

<p>“Well, niece,” said the old man sharply. “What do
you want now?”</p>

<p>“Is the cold mutton in the larder for dinner, Uncle
Si?” said June with a slight but becoming blush at being
called upon to speak in the presence of such a very
nice looking young man.</p>

<p>“What else do you think we are going to have?
Truffles in aspic or patty de four grass?”</p>

<p>“No, Uncle Si,” said June gravely.</p>

<p>“Very well then,” growled S. Gedge Antiques.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was not until the evening, after tea, when S.
Gedge Antiques had gone by bus to Clerkenwell in
order to buy a Queen Anne sofa from a dealer in difficulties
that William and June really became known to
one another. Before then, however, their respective
presences had already charged the atmosphere of No.
46 New Cross Street with a rare and subtle quality.</p>

<p>William, even at a first glance, had been intrigued
more than a little by the appearance of the niece. To
begin with she was a great contrast to Mrs. Runciman.
She looked as clean and bright as a new pin, she had
beautiful teeth, her hair was of the kind that artists
want to paint and her way of doing it was cunning.
Moreover, she was as straight as a willow, her movements
had charm and grace, and her eyes were grey.
And beyond all else her smile was full of friendship.</p>

<p>As for June, her first thought had been, when she
had unexpectedly come upon William holding up to
the light the picture he had bought at Crowdham Market,
that the young man had an air at once very gentle
and very nice. And in the first talk they had together
in the course of that evening, during the providential
absence of Uncle Si, this view of William was fully
confirmed.</p>

<p>He was very gentle and he was very nice.</p>

<p>The conversation began shortly after seven o’clock
when William had put up the shutters and locked the
door of the shop. It was he who opened the ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve come to stay, Miss Gedge, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said June, “if I can make myself useful to
Uncle Si.”</p>

<p>“But aren’t you adopted? The master said a fortnight
ago he was going to adopt you.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Si says I’m half and half at present,” said
June demurely. “I’m a month on trial. If I suit his
ways he says I can stay, but if I don’t I must get after
a job.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will stay,” said William with obvious
sincerity.</p>

<p>There was enough Woman in the heart of the niece
of S. Gedge Antiques to cause her to smile to herself.
This was a perfect Simple Simon of a fellow, yet she
could not deny that there was something about him
which gave her quite a thrill.</p>

<p>“Why do you hope so?” asked Woman, with seeming
innocence.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I do, unless it is that you are so
perfectly nice to talk to.” And the Simpleton grew
suddenly red at his own immoderation.</p>

<p>Woman in her cardinal aspect might have said
“Really” in a tone of ice; she might even have been
tempted to ridicule such a statement made by such a
young man; but Woman in the shrewdly perceptive
person of June was now aware that this air of quaint
sincerity was a thing with which no girl truly wise
would dare to trifle. William was William and must
be treated accordingly.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you very clever?”</p>

<p>She knew he was clever, but for a reason she couldn’t
divine she was anxious to let him know that she knew
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I am at all.”</p>

<p>“But you are,” said June. “You must be very clever
indeed to go about the country buying rare things cheap
for Uncle Si to sell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, anybody can pick up a few odds and ends now
and again if one has been given the money to buy
them.”</p>

<p>“Anybody couldn’t. I couldn’t for one.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that because you’ve not been brought up to
the business?”</p>

<p>“It’s more than that,” said June shrewdly. “You
must have a special gift for picking up things of
value.”</p>

<p>“I may have,” the young man modestly allowed.
“The master trusts me as a rule to tell whether a thing
is genuine.”</p>

<p>June pinned him with her eyes. “Then tell me this.”
Her suddenness took him completely by surprise. “Is
<i>he</i> genuine?”</p>

<p>“Who? The master!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;Uncle Si.”</p>

<p>The answer came without an instant’s hesitation.
“Yes, Miss June, he is. The master is a genuine
piece.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it,” said June with a slight
frown.</p>

<p>“Yes, the master is genuine.” Depth and conviction
were in the young man’s tone. “In fact,” he added
slowly, “you might say he is a museum piece.”</p>

<p>At this solemnity June smiled.</p>

<p>“He’s a very good man.” A warmth of affection
fused the simple words. “Why he took me from down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
there as you might say.” William pointed to the
ground. “And now I’m his assistant.”</p>

<p>“At how much a week,” said the practical June, “if
the question isn’t rude?”</p>

<p>“I get fifteen shillings.”</p>

<p>“A week?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And board and lodging.”</p>

<p>She looked the young man steadily in the eyes. “You
are worth more.”</p>

<p>“If the master thinks I’m worth more, he’ll give it
to me.”</p>

<p>June pursed her lips and shook a dubious head. Evidently
she was not convinced.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m sure he will. In fact, he’s promised
to raise my wages half a crown from the first of the
new year.”</p>

<p>“I should just think so!” said June looking him still
in the eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course I always get everything found.”</p>

<p>“What about your clothes?”</p>

<p>With an air of apology he had to own that clothes
were not included; yet to offset this reluctant admission
he laid stress on the fact that his master had taught
him all that he knew.</p>

<p>June could not resist a frown. Nice as he was, she
would not have minded shaking him a little. No Simon
had a right to be quite so simple as this one.</p>

<p>A pause followed. And then the young man suddenly
said: “Miss June would you care to see something
I bought the other day at Crowdham Market?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to,” said the gracious Miss June. She
had seen ‘the something’ already but just now she was
by no means averse from having another look at it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps you wouldn’t mind coming up to the
studio.” William laughed shyly. “I call it that, although
of course it isn’t a studio really. And I only
call it that to myself you know,” he added naïvely.</p>

<p>“Then why did you call it ‘the studio’ to me?” archly
demanded Woman in the person of the niece of S.
Gedge Antiques.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why, I’m sure. It was silly.”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t,” said Woman. “Rather nice of you,
I think.”</p>

<p>The simpleton flushed to the roots of his thick and
waving chestnut hair which was brushed back from a
high forehead in a most becoming manner; and then
with rare presence of mind, in order to give his confusion
a chance, he showed the way up the two flights
of stairs which led direct to June’s attic. Next to it,
with only a thin wall dividing them, was a kind of extension
of her own private cubicle, a fairly large and
well lit room, which its occupant had immodestly called
“a studio.” A bed, a washing stand, and a chest of
drawers were tucked away in a far corner, as if they
didn’t belong.</p>

<p>“The master lets me have this all to myself for the
sake of the light,” said the young man in a happy voice
as he threw open the door. “One needs a good light
to work by.”</p>

<p>With the air of a Leonardo receiving a lady of the
Colonnas he ushered her in.</p>

<p>A feminine eye embraced all at a glance. The walls
of bare whitewash bathed in the glories of an autumn
sunset, the clean skylight, the two easels with rather
dilapidated objects upon them, a litter of tools and canvases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and frames, a pervading odour of turpentine,
and a look of rapture upon the young man’s face.</p>

<p>“But it <i>is</i> a studio,” said June. Somehow she felt
greatly impressed by it. “I’ve never seen one before,
but it’s just like what one reads about in books.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, a studio is where pictures are painted. Here
they are only cleaned and restored.”</p>

<p>“One day perhaps you’ll paint them.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will; I don’t know.” He sighed a little,
too shy to confess his dream. “But that day’s a long
way off.”</p>

<p>“It mayn’t be, you know.”</p>

<p>He had begun already to try, but as yet it was a
secret from the world. “<i>Ars est celare artem</i>,” he
said.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Life is short, art eternal. It is the motto of the old
man who teaches me how to clean and renovate these
things. He says it keeps him up to his work.”</p>

<p>“You go to an art school?”</p>

<p>“I should hardly call it that. But the master wants
me to learn as much as I can of the practical side of
the trade, so he’s having me taught. And the more I
can pick up about pictures, the better it will be for the
business. You see, the master doesn’t pretend to know
much about pictures himself. His line is furniture.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say you were clever?” June could not help
feeling a little proud of her own perception.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t say that”&mdash;the young man’s tone was
sad&mdash;“if you really knew how little I know. But allow
me to show you what I bought at Crowdham Market.
There it is.” He pointed to the old picture on the
smaller easel, which now divorced from its frame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
seemed to June a mere daub, black, dilapidated, old and
worthless.</p>

<p>She could not conceal her disappointment. “I don’t
call that anything.”</p>

<p>“No!” He could not conceal his disappointment
either. “Take this glass.” A microscope was handed
to her. “Please look at it ve-ry ve-ry closely while I
hold it for you in the light.”</p>

<p>June gave the canvas a most rigorous scrutiny, but
she had to own at last that the only thing she could see
was dirt.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see water?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>With his finger nail the young man found water.</p>

<p>“No,” said June stoutly. “I don’t see a single drop.
And that’s a pity, because in my opinion, it would be
none the worse for a good wash.”</p>

<p>This was a facer but he met it valiantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see trees?”</p>

<p>“Where are the trees?”</p>

<p>The young man disclosed trees with his finger nail.</p>

<p>“I can’t see a twig.”</p>

<p>“But you can see a cloud.” With his finger nail he
traced a cloud.</p>

<p>“I only see dirt and smudge,” said June the downright.
“To my mind this isn’t a picture at all.”</p>

<p>“Surely, you can see a windmill?”</p>

<p>“A windmill! Why there’s not a sign of one.”</p>

<p>“Wait till it’s really clean,” said William with the
optimism of genius. He took up a knife and began
delicately to scrape that dark surface from which already
he had half removed a top layer of paint that
some inferior artist had placed there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>June shook her head. There was a lovely fall in the
young man’s voice but it would take more than that to
convince her. She believed her eyes to be as good as
most people’s, but even with a microscope and William’s
finger to help them they could see never a sign
of a cloud or so much as a hint of water. As for a tree!...
and a windmill!... either this handsome
young man ... he really was handsome ... had
a sense that ordinary people had not ... or
... or...!</p>

lay the supper.</p>

<p>William modestly asked to be allowed to help.</p>

<p>“Can you lay supper?” Polite the tone, but June
was inclined to think that here was the limit to William’s
cleverness.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Miss June, I lay it nearly always. It’s part
of my work.”</p>

<p>“Glad of your help, of course.” The tone was gracious.
“But I daresay you’d like to go on looking for
a windmill.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think perhaps I would.” It was not quite
the answer of diplomacy, but behind it was a weight of
sincerity that took away the sting.</p>

<p>“Thought so,” said June, with a dark smile. It
would have been pleasant to have had the help of this
accomplished young man, but above all things she was
practical and so understood that the time of such a
one must be of great value.</p>

<p>“But I’m thinking you’ll have to look some while
for that windmill,” she said, trying not to be satirical.</p>

<p>“The windmill I’ll not swear to, but I’m sure there’s
water and trees; although, of course, it may take some
time to find them.” William took up a piece of cotton
wool. “But we’ll see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>He moistened the wool with a solvent, which he kept
in a bottle, a mysterious compound of vegetable oils
and mineral water; and then, not too hard, he began to
rub the surface of the picture.</p>

<p>“I hope we shall,” said June, doubtfully. And she
went downstairs with an air of scepticism she was
unable to hide.</p>

<p>Supper, in the main, was an affair of bread and
cheese and a jug of beer, drawn from the barrel in the
larder. It was not taken until a quarter past nine when
S. Gedge Antiques had returned from Clerkenwell.
The old man was in quite a good humour; in fact, it
might be said, to verge upon the expansive. He had
managed to buy the Queen Anne sofa for four pounds.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a bargain, sir,” said William. It was
William who had discovered the sofa, and had strongly
advised its purchase.</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” said his master, who
would have been vastly disappointed had there been
reason to think that he had not got a bargain.</p>

<p>After supper, when the old man had put on his slippers
and an ancient smoking cap that made him look
like a Turkish pasha, he took from the chimneypiece
a pipe and a jar of tobacco, drew the easy chair to the
fire, and began to read the evening paper.</p>

<p>“By the way, boy,” he remarked, quizzingly, “have
you started yet on that marvellous thing you were
clever enough to buy at Ipswich?”</p>

<p>“Crowdham Market, sir.”</p>

<p>“Crowdham Market, was it? Well, my father used
to say that fools and money soon part company.”</p>

<p>June, who was clearing the table, could not forbear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
from darting at the young man a gleam of triumph.
It was clear that Uncle Si believed no more in the windmill,
not to mention the trees and the water than did
she.</p>

<p>A start had been made, but William confessed to a
fear that it might be a long job to get it clean.</p>

<p>“And when you get it clean,” said his master, “what
do you expect to find, eh?&mdash;that’s if you’re lucky
enough to find anything.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know,” said William frankly.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” S. Gedge Antiques scratched a cheek
of rather humorous cynicism. And then in sheer expansion
of mood, he went to the length of winking at
his niece. “Perhaps, boy,” he said, “you’ll find that
Van Roon that was cut out of its frame at the Louvre
in the Nineties, and has never been seen or heard of
since.”</p>

<p>“Was there one, sir?” asked William, interested and
alert.</p>

<p>The old man took up the evening paper, and began to
read. “Canvas sixteen inches by twelve&mdash;just about
your size, eh? One of the world’s masterpieces. Large
reward for recovery been on offer for more than twenty-five
years by French Government&mdash;but not claimed
yet seemingly. Said to be finest Van Roon in existence.
Now’s your chance, boy.” A second time S.
Gedge Antiques winked at his niece; and then folding
back the page of the <i>Evening News</i>, he handed it to
William, with the air of a very sly dog indeed. “See
for yourself. Special article. Mystery of Famous
Missing Picture. When you find the signature of
Mynheer Van Roon in the corner of this masterpiece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
of yours, I shouldn’t wonder if you’re able to set up
in business for yourself.”</p>

<p>Allowing Fancy a loose rein in this benign hour,
the old man, for the third time honoured his niece with
a solemn wink.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> next morning saw the beginning of a chain
of epoch-making events in the history of S.
Gedge Antiques.</p>

<p>Shortly before eight o’clock Mrs. Runciman turned
up as usual after her day off. With a most businesslike
promptitude, however, she was given her quietus.
In dispensing with her services, from now on, Uncle
Si took a real pleasure in what he called “telling her
off.” Many times had he warned her that she would
play the trick once too often. And now that his prophecy
had come true, he was able to say just what he
thought of her, of her ancestry, and of her sex in
general. She would greatly oblige him by not letting
him see her face again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Runciman, for her part, professed a cheerful
willingness to take her late employer at his word.
There was plenty of work to be had; and she departed
on a note of dignity which she sustained by informing
him in a voice loud enough for the neighbours to hear
that “he was a miser, and a screw, and that he would
skin a flea for its feathers.”</p>

<p>On the top of this ukase to the char, the old man held
a short private conversation with his niece. June had
begun very well; and if she continued to behave herself,
got up in the morning without being called, was
not afraid of hard work, and had the breakfast ready
by a quarter to eight she would receive, in addition to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
board and lodging, two shillings a week pocket money,
and perhaps a small present at Christmas.</p>

<p>As far as it went this was very well. “But,” said
June, “there’s my clothes, Uncle Si.”</p>

<p>“Clothes!” The old man scratched his cheek.
“You’ve money of your own, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Only twenty pounds.”</p>

<p>“We’ll think about clothes when the time comes to
buy some.”</p>

<p>S. Gedge, however, admitted to William privately
that he had hopes of the niece. “But let me tell you
this, boy: it’s asking for trouble to have a young female
sleeping in the house. Old ones are bad enough,
even when they sleep out; young ones sleeping in may
be the very mischief.”</p>

<p>In fact, the old man deemed it wise to reinforce
these observations with a solemn warning. “Understand,
boy, there must be no carrying on between you
and her.”</p>

<p>“Carrying on, sir!” Such innocence might have
touched the heart of King Herod.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said. I can trust you; in some ways
you hardly know you’re born; but with a woman, and
a young one at that, it’s another pair o’ shoes. Women
are simply the devil.”</p>

<p>William’s blank face showed a fleck of scarlet; yet
the true inwardness of these Menander-like words were
lost upon him; and he was rebuked for being a perfect
fool in things that mattered. However, the arrangement
was merely temporary. If the girl behaved herself,
well and good; if she didn’t behave herself, niece
or no niece, she would have to go. But&mdash;touching
wood!&mdash;there was nothing to complain of so far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>William quite agreed, yet he dare not say as much
to his master. In his opinion, there was no ground for
comparison between the dethroned goddess of whom
he had always been a little in awe, and the creature of
grace and charm, of fine perception and feminine
amenity who slept the other side the “studio” wall.
For all that, in the sight of this young man, one aspect
of the case was now a matter of concern.</p>

<p>“Miss June,” he said on the evening of the second
day, “do you mind if I get up early to-morrow and do
a few odd jobs about the house?”</p>

<p>“What sort of jobs?” Miss June’s air of suspicion
was tinged with sternness. Now that she reigned in
Mrs. Runciman’s stead she could not help feeling
rather important.</p>

<p>“If you’ll show me where the brushes are kept, I’ll
blacklead the kitchen grate.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t come interfering.” In June’s manner
was a touch of hauteur.</p>

<p>Beneath the tan of East Anglia, the young man
coloured. “But you’ll spoil your hands,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“My hands are no affair of yours,” said June, a little
touched, and trying not to show it.</p>

<p>“Let me take over the kitchen grate for the future.
And if you don’t mind, I’ll scrub the shop floor.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything else you’d like to do?” said June,
with amused scorn.</p>

<p>“I’d like to do all the really rough jobs if I may.”</p>

<p>“For why?”</p>

<p>The Sawney had given his reason already, and, in
spite of a growing embarrassment, he stuck to his
guns.</p>

<p>Said June sternly: “You mustn’t come interfering.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Yet the light in her eyes was not anger. “You’ve got
your department and I’ve got mine. Windmills are
your department. Blackleading kitchen grates and
cleaning floors won’t help you to find windmills. Besides,
you have the shop to look after, and you have to
go out and find things for Uncle Si, and study art, and
talk to customers, and goodness knows what you
haven’t got to do.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t mind,” said William tenaciously,
“I’ll get in the coal, anyway.”</p>

<p>June shook her head. “No interference,” was her
last word.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the following morning saw a division
of labour within the precincts of No. 46, New Cross
Street. When June came downstairs at a quarter to
seven, she found a young man on his knees vigorously
polishing the kitchen grate. He was sans coat, waistcoat
and collar; there was a smudge on the side of his
nose, and as the temper of a lady is apt to be short at
so early an hour, it was no wonder that he was rebuked
crushingly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say I wouldn’t have interference? I don’t
come into your studio and look for windmills, do I?”</p>

<p>William, still on his knees, had penitently to own
that she didn’t.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s a great liberty,” said June, hotly.</p>

<p>He looked up at her with an air to disarm the Furies.
“Oh&mdash;please&mdash;no!”</p>

<p>“What is it then?” Secretly she was annoyed with
herself for not being as much annoyed as the case demanded.
“What is it then? Coming into my kitchen
with your interference.”</p>

<p>“I’m ever so sorry, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“I simply can’t bear to think of your spoiling your
beautiful hands.”</p>

<p>June’s eyes were fire; her cheek flamed like a peony.
“Go and look for your beautiful windmills, and leave
my hands alone.”</p>

<p>But the owner of the beautiful hands was now fettered
by the knowledge that she was beginning to blush
horribly.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the evening of the next day, about half an hour
before supper, June climbed the attic stairs and
knocked boldly upon the studio door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” a gentle voice invited her.</p>

<p>William, a lump of cotton wool in one hand, the
mysterious bottle in the other, was absorbed in the task
of looking for a windmill. He had to own, the queer
fellow, that so far success had not crowned his search.</p>

<p>“I should think not,” said June, uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>“But there are the trees.” William took up a knife
and laid the point to a canvas that was already several
tones lighter than of yore.</p>

<p>There was a pause while June screwed up her eyes
like an expert; and in consequence she had reluctantly
to admit that they were unmistakable trees.</p>

<p>“And now we are coming to the water, don’t you
see?” said the young man in a tone of quiet ecstasy.</p>

<p>“Where’s the water?”</p>

<p>With a lover’s delicacy, William ran the point of the
knife along the canvas.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see it, Miss June?” There was a thrill
in the low voice.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said June. “It’s water, right enough.”
No use trying now not to be impressed. “Now I call
that rather clever!”</p>

<p>“I knew it was there. And if you know a thing’s
there, sooner or later you are bound to find it. Do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
know what my opinion is?” Of a sudden, the exalted
voice sank mysteriously.</p>

<p>June had no idea what William’s opinion was, but
she was quite willing to hear it, whatever it might be,
for he had just had a considerable rise in her estimation.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t surprise me at all if this turns out to be
a&mdash;&mdash;” He broke off with a perplexing smile.</p>

<p>“Turns out to be a what?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better not say.” The words, in their
caution and their gravity intrigued a shrewd daughter
of the midlands. June, in spite of herself, was beginning
to respect this odd young man.</p>

<p>“You think it might be something very good?”</p>

<p>“It might be something almost <i>too</i> good.” William’s
tone had a deep vibration. “If it keeps on coming out
like this, it’ll be wonderful. Do you see that cloud?”</p>

<p>June peered hard, but she could not see a suspicion
of a cloud.</p>

<p>“Take the microscope.”</p>

<p>Even with the microscope no cloud was visible to
June.</p>

<p>“I’m as sure of it as I ever was of anything,” said
William. “There’s a cloud&mdash;oh, yes!” The note of
faith was music. “And there’s a sky&mdash;oh, yes!” A
stray beam of the September sunset made an effect so
remarkable, as it slanted across the upturned eyes, that
June paid them rather more attention at the moment
than she gave to the canvas.</p>

<p>“Has Uncle Si seen those trees?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes, the master came up to look at them a few minutes
ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He just scratched his cheek and changed his spectacles.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him what you’ve just told me?”</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>“Did Uncle Si believe you?”</p>

<p>“He said he’d wait till he saw it.”</p>

<p>“Well, he can’t deny the trees, anyway.”</p>

<p>“No, he can’t deny the trees. But, of course the
real picture is only just beginning to come out, as you
might say. All the same, he’s made me an offer for
it, even as it stands.”</p>

<p>With a swift, sudden intuition, June cried: “I hope
you haven’t taken it!”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, I haven’t,” said William, casually.
“I feel I’d like to keep the picture until I find out
what it really is.”</p>

<p>“Well, mind you do. And, if the question isn’t a
rude one, what did Uncle Si offer?”</p>

<p>“Seven and sixpence. But that’s for the frame
mainly.”</p>

<p>June grew magisterial. “You mustn’t think of parting
with it.”</p>

<p>With an innocence hard to credit in one so clever,
William asked why.</p>

<p>“Why!” June almost snorted. “Because if Uncle
Si offers you seven and sixpence for a thing which he
knows you bought for five shillings, you can be sure
that he considers it may be valuable.”</p>

<p>“The master has always been very good to me,”
said the young man with extreme simplicity.</p>

<p>At these words June felt a stab of pain, so great was
the contrast between the two men. One saw the wares<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
in which they dealt only in terms of beauty, the other
in terms of money.</p>

<p>“You are too modest. And, although you are so
clever, if you don’t mind my saying so, you are also
rather foolish in some ways&mdash;at least that’s my
opinion.”</p>

<p>William frankly admitted the impeachment.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said June, a cool and steady eye upon
him, “suppose you tell me where you think your foolishness
lies?”</p>

<p>“Why, I was foolish enough to think that patch”&mdash;the
Simpleton pressed the finger of an artist upon the
patch&mdash;“was really and truly a windmill. But, of
course, it’s nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>“I’m not speaking of windmills now,” said June
severely. “I’m speaking of things much more important.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but a windmill can be very important. Have
you ever really seen a windmill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, I have.”</p>

<p>The Sawney asked where.</p>

<p>June had seen a windmill in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>“Lincolnshire! Oh, but you should see the one in
the National Gallery.”</p>

<p>“The one in the where?” said June, with a frown.</p>

<p>Of a sudden his voice took its delicious fall. The
rare smile, which lit his face, was for June an enchantment:
“It’s a Hobbema.”</p>

<p>“A what!&mdash;emma!”</p>

<p>“A Hobbema. On Saturdays the shop closes at one,
so that I could take you to see it, if you’d care to. I
should like you so much to see it&mdash;that’s if it interests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
you at all. It will give you an idea of what a windmill
can be.”</p>

<p>“But I meant a real windmill. I’m only interested
in real things, anyway.”</p>

<p>“A Hobbema is better than real.”</p>

<p>“Better than real,” said June, opening wide eyes.</p>

<p>“When you see it, you’ll understand what I mean. I
do hope you’ll come and look at it.”</p>

<p>June was such a practical person that her first instinct
was to refuse to do anything of the kind. But
that instinct was overborne by the complexity of her
feelings. In some ways he was the simplest Simon of
them all; a longing to shake him was growing upon
her, but the disconcerting fact remained that after a
fashion he was decidedly clever. And leaving his mental
qualities out of the case, when you got his face at
an angle and you caught the light in his eyes, he was
by far the handsomest young man she had ever seen.
Therefore her promise was reluctantly given that on
Saturday afternoon she would go with him to the National
Gallery to see what a windmill was really like.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une’s</span> promise was made on the evening of Monday.
Before it could be fulfilled, however, much
had to happen. Saturday itself was put out of the
case by the departure of William early that morning
to attend a sale in Essex, where several things might
be going cheap. And on the following Thursday he
had to go to Tunbridge Wells. During his absence on
that day, moreover, June’s interest in the picture he
had bought at Crowdham Market was roused suddenly
to a very high pitch.</p>

<p>Even before this significant event occurred, her mind
had been full of this much-discussed purchase. Day
by day William wrought upon it with growing enthusiasm.
There was now no more doubt in regard to the
clouds and the sky than there was as to the trees and
the water. S. Gedge Antiques had been up to the attic
several times to see for himself, and although in his
opinion, the best that could be said for the picture was
that it might turn out to be a copy of a fair example
of the Dutch School, he went to the length of doubling
his offer of seven and sixpence. In other words, which
he issued with point at the supper table on the evening
prior to William’s trip to Tunbridge Wells, there was
“a full week’s extra wages sticking out,” if only the
young man cared to take it in exchange for a dubious
work of little or no value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>William needed, among other things, a new pair of
boots; he was short of the materials of his craft, and
the sum of fifteen shillings meant a great deal to him
at any time, facts with which his employer was well
acquainted. The temptation was great. While the
offer was under consideration, June held her breath.
She had a frantic desire to signal across the table to
William not to part with his treasure. Much to her
relief, however, the young man resisted the lure. His
master told him roundly that only a fool would refuse
such an offer. William allowed that it was princely,
but he had quite an affection for the picture now, besides,
much had to be done to get it really clean.</p>

<p>At present, moreover, he had not even begun to look
for the signature.</p>

<p>“Signature!” S. Gedge Antiques took up the word
sarcastically. And there were times, as June knew
already, when the old man could be terribly sarcastic.
“You’ll be looking, I suppose, for the signature of
Hobbema. Seems to me, boy, you’re cracked on that
subject.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think, sir,” said William, in his gentle voice,
“that this picture is a Hobbema.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you indeed?” To conceal a rising impatience
Uncle Si made a face at his niece. “You’re cracked,
my boy.” He gave his own forehead a symbolical tap.
“Why waste your time looking for a signature to a
thing you bought for five shillings at an old serendipity
shop at Crowdham Market! You’d far better turn
over a snug little profit of two hundred per cent and
forget all about it.”</p>

<p>The next day, however, when William set out for
Tunbridge Wells, he was still the owner of the picture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
And in the light of what was to follow it was a fact of
considerable importance.</p>

<p>In the course of that morning, while June was helping
Uncle Si to dress the front window, there sauntered
into the shop a funny, oldish, foxy little man, who wore
a brown billycock hat at the back of his head, and had
a pair of legs as crooked as a Louis Quinze chair. She
set him down at once as a character out of Dickens.</p>

<p>“Mornin’ to you, Mr. Gedge,” said this quaint
visitor.</p>

<p>“Mornin’ to you, Mr. Thornton!” said S. Gedge
Antiques returning the salutation with deference.</p>

<p>June cocked her ears. The note in Uncle Si’s rasping
voice, which always seemed to need a file, told her
at once that the visitor was no common man.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to business, whatever that business
might be, Mr. Thornton fixed an eye like a small bright
bead on the Hoodoo, whose sinister bulk seemed to
dominate half the shop. It was fixed, moreover, with
an air of whimsical appreciation as he murmured:
“The British Museum is the place for that.”</p>

<p>“There I’m with you, Mr. Thornton.” S. Gedge
Antiques looked his visitor steadily in the eye. “Wonderful
example of early Polynesian craftsmanship.”</p>

<p>“Early Polynesian craftsmanship.” The little man
stroked the belly of the Hoodoo with a kind of rapt
delicacy which other men reserve for the fetlock of a
horse.</p>

<p>“Only one of its kind.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” murmured Louis Quinze-legs,
screwing up his eyes; and then, by way of after-thought:
“I’ve just dropped in, Mr. Gedge, to have a
look at that picture you mentioned to me yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, <i>that</i>, Mr. Thornton.” The voice of S. Gedge
Antiques suggested that the matter was of such little
consequence that it had almost passed from his mind.
“S’pose I’d better get it for you.” And then with an
odd burst of agility, which in one of his years was quite
surprising, the old man left the shop, while June, her
heart beating high, went on dressing the window.</p>

<p>In three minutes or less, William’s picture appeared
under the arm of William’s master. “Here you are,
Mr. Thornton!” The voice was oil.</p>

<p>June made herself small between a Chinese cabinet
and a tallboys in the window’s deepest gorge. From
this point of vantage, the privilege of seeing and hearing
all that passed in the shop was still hers.</p>

<p>Foxy Face received the picture in silence from Uncle
Si, held it to his eyes, pursed his lips, took a glass from
his pocket, and examined it minutely back and front,
turning it over and tapping it several times in the process.
The slow care he gave to this ritual began to get
on June’s nerves.</p>

<p>“There’s good work in it,” said Louis Quinze-legs, at
last.</p>

<p>“Good work in it!” said S. Gedge Antiques in what
June called his “selling” voice. “I should just think
there was.”</p>

<p>“But there’s one thing it lacks.” The little man,
looking more than ever like a fox, chose each word
with delicacy. “It’s a pity&mdash;a very great pity&mdash;there’s
no signature.”</p>

<p>“Signature!” The old man’s tone had lost the
drawling sneer of the previous evening. “Tell me, Mr.
Thornton,&mdash;&mdash;” He must have forgotten that June
was so near&mdash;“if we happened to come upon the signature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of Hobbema down there in that left hand corner&mdash;in
that black splotch&mdash;what do you suppose it
might be worth?”</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton did not answer the question at once.
And when answer he did, his voice was so low that
June could hardly hear it. “I wouldn’t like to say offhand,
Mr. Gedge. Mosby sent a Hobbema to New
York last year, but what he got for it I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I heard twenty-eight thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“So did I, but I doubt it. Still, the Americans are
paying big money just now. Did you see that thing
of Mosby’s, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it was a bit larger than this chap, but it hadn’t
the work in it.”</p>

<p>“Well, get it a bit cleaner; and then, if you can show
me Hobbema’s signature with the date, about the place
where I’ve got my finger, I dare say we can come to
business, Mr. Gedge.”</p>

<p>“I quite expect we’ll be able to do that,” said the old
man with an air of robust optimism which surprised
June considerably.</p>

<p>Foxy Face ventured to hope that such might be the
case, whereupon the voice of Uncle Si fell to a pitch
which his niece had to strain a keen ear to catch.</p>

<p>“Suppose, Mr. Thornton, we omit the question of
the signature? Do you feel inclined to make an offer
for the picture as it stands?”</p>

<p>The pause which followed was long and tense, and
then June was just able to hear the cautious voice of
Foxy Face. “Possibly, Mr. Gedge&mdash;I dare say I
might. But before I could think of doing that, I
should like a friend of mine to vet it. He’s wise in
these things, and knows what can be done with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“Right you are, Mr. Thornton,” said S. Gedge Antiques
brisk and businesslike. “If you can tell me
when your friend is likely to call, I’ll be here to meet
him.”</p>

<p>“Shall we say to-morrow morning at ten?”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Gedge. And if my friend can’t
come, I’ll telephone.”</p>

<p>Foxy Face was bowed out of the shop with a politeness
that fairly astonished June. She could hardly
believe that this mirror of courtesy was Uncle Si. In
fact, it was as if the old man had had a change of heart.
With the light step of a boy, he took back the picture
to the attic, while June, thinking hard, retired to the
back premises to cook two middling-sized potatoes for
dinner.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T</span> was not until the evening that William returned
from Tunbridge Wells. He had been to look at a
picture which his master had seen already, but S. Gedge
Antiques was wise enough to recognise that his assistant
had an instinct for pictures far beyond his own.
In the matter of bric-à-brac he would always trust his
own judgment, but when it came to an oil painting he
was very glad to have it fortified by the special and
peculiar knowledge that William had now acquired.
There was no doubt that in this sphere, which for his
master was comparatively new and full of pitfalls, the
young man had a remarkable gift. It was a gift, moreover,
of which he had yet to learn the true value.</p>

<p>In “summer-time” September the days are long;
and as supper was not until nine o’clock, there was
light enough for William, on getting home, to spend a
rare hour in the studio, delving for further beauties in
that derelict canvas which already had far exceeded
his hopes.</p>

<p>“I know where you are going,” whispered June, in
the young man’s ear as he left the little sitting-room
behind the shop, where sat Uncle Si, spectacles on nose,
poring over the pages of Crowe and Cavalcaselle.</p>

<p>The young man glowed at this friendly interest on
the part of Miss June; in fact, he was touched by it.
She was the master’s niece; therefore she was on a
plane of being superior to his own. And he had
learned already that those who are above you in the
world, are apt to turn their advantage to your detriment;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
but Miss June, for all that she was the master’s
niece and had been one term at the Blackhampton High
School, and was therefore a person of social weight,
had been careful so far not to assert her status. And
so his heart was open to her; besides this present keen
interest in his labours was most encouraging.</p>

<p>“I’m coming up to look at it again, if I may,” whispered
June, as she followed him out of the room.</p>

<p>“Please, please do,” he said, delightedly.</p>

<p>As she climbed the steep stairs, William in the seventh
heaven, followed close upon her heels. What a
pleasure to expound the merits of such a work to one
so sympathetic! As for June, her quick mind was at
work. Even before the coming of Foxy Face she had
guessed, or some instinct had told her, that this picture
was no ordinary one, and now that she had overheard
that gentleman’s recent talk with Uncle Si she had
been given furiously to think. To understand all its
implications needed far more knowledge of a deep,
not to say “tricky,” subject than she possessed, but one
fact was clear: her opinion as to the picture’s value was
fully confirmed. Here was a treasure whose real
worth even William himself might not be able to guess.</p>

<p>Now was the moment, June shrewdly saw, for
prompt and decisive action. Uncle Si had set his heart
upon this rare thing; but if flesh and blood was equal
to the task, she must take immediate steps to baulk him.
Alas, she knew only too well that it was likely to prove
an immensely difficult matter.</p>

<p>June stood in front of the easel, and set her head to
one side quite in the manner of an expert.</p>

<p>“It seems to grow finer and finer,” she said, in a soft
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it does,” said William, touching it here and
there with loverly fingers. “If I can but manage to
get the top off without hurting the fabric, I’m sure it’ll
be a non-such.”</p>

<p>June fervently said that she hoped it would be.</p>

<p>“There’s the cloud I spoke to you about the other
day.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said June, screwing up her eyes, in unconscious
imitation of Foxy Face. “I see it now. And
it’s very beautiful indeed.”</p>

<p>“And the touch of sunlight in it. I hope you notice
that!” As William spoke, it almost seemed to June
that she could see the reflection of the sunlight in the
eyes of this enthusiast.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said June stoutly.</p>

<p>“A real painter has done that!” The young man’s
voice took that dying fall she had learnt already to
listen for. “This is a lovely thing, Miss June!” Pure
cadence touched her heart with fire. “Do you know,
I am beginning to think this little picture is the most
perfect thing I have ever seen?”</p>

<p>“Very valuable, I dare say,” said June, bringing him
to earth.</p>

<p>“I only know it’s good.”</p>

<p>“But surely if it’s good it’s valuable? What do you
think it might be worth?”</p>

<p>“Miss June,”&mdash;the queer little tremble in his voice
sounded divine&mdash;“don’t let us think of it as money.”</p>

<p>But at those hushed words, at the far-off look in the
deep eyes, she felt once more a touch of pain.</p>

<p>“Uncle Si would call that sentiment. He believes
that money is the most important thing there is; he
believes it is the only thing that matters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>She meant it as a facer for this Sawney, who had declared
to her that Uncle Si could neither think wrong
nor ensue it. A hit, shrewd and fair, but the Sawney
was still in business.</p>

<p>“In a manner of speaking, it may be so. But I am
sure the master will tell you there are things money
can’t buy.”</p>

<p>“What are they?” June’s frown was the fiercer for
the effort to repress it.</p>

<p>“Take this glint of sun striking through that wonderful
cloud. All the money in the world couldn’t buy
that.”</p>

<p>“Of course it could. And I don’t suppose it would
take much to buy it either.”</p>

<p>He solemnly dissented. She asked why not.</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “that bit of sunlight only exists
in the eye that sees it.”</p>

<p>“That’s sentiment,” said June severely. “You
might say the same of anything.”</p>

<p>“You might, of course. Nothing is, but thinking
makes it so.”</p>

<p>Again June heard the queer little tremble in his
voice, again she saw that strange look steal across his
face.</p>

<p>“What you say sounds very deep, but if you talk in
that way I’m quite sure you’ll never get on in the
world.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be quite happy to live as I am, if only I’m allowed
to see the wonderful things that are in it.”</p>

<p>June had a fierce desire to shake him, but he beamed
upon her, and she became a lamb.</p>

<p>“On Saturday,” he said, “when we go to our little
treasure house, you will see what I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“If you talk in this way,” said June once more severe,
“I shall not go with you on Saturday to your little
treasure house. Or on Sunday either. Or on any day
of the week. If you were a millionaire, you could
afford to be fanciful. Being what you are, and your
salary less than half what it should be, I really think
you ought to be ashamed of yourself.”</p>

<p>She was a little astonished at her own vehemence.
He seemed a little astonished at it also.</p>

<p>“Nothing is, but thinking makes it so,” said June,
with fine scorn. “That’s what Mr. Boultby, the druggist
at the bottom of our street at home, would call
poppycock. It means you’ll be very lucky if some fine
morning you don’t wake up and find yourself in the
workhouse.”</p>

<p>One smile more he gave her out of his deep eyes.</p>

<p>“That sort of talk,” said June, with growing fierceness,
“is just <i>potty</i>. It won’t find you tools and a place
to work in, or three meals a day, and a bed at night.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see what I mean?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. As I say, to my mind it’s potty. But
now tell me, what do you think this picture’s worth if
you were buying it for Uncle Si to sell again?”</p>

<p>“That is a very difficult question to answer. The
master is so clever at selling things that he might get a
big price for it in the market.”</p>

<p>“Even without the signature?” And June fixed the
eye of a hawk on the young man’s face.</p>

<p>“I don’t say that. The signature might make a lot
of difference to a dealer. But don’t let us talk of the
price. There are things in this picture that money
ought not to buy.”</p>

<p>An impatient “Poppycock!” all but escaped Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Boultby’s disciple. Yet of a sudden, in a fashion so
unexpected as to verge upon drama, her own voice took
that soft quick fall he had taught her the trick of.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how much I love it,” she said,
dreamily. “I would give almost anything if it were
mine.”</p>

<p>William’s limpid glance betrayed that he was only
too happy to believe her.</p>

<p>“It is quite as beautiful to me as it is to you.” June
plunged on, but she did not dare to look at him. “And
I think it would be a terrible pity if it ever came to be
sold by Uncle Si. I simply love it. Suppose you sell
it to me?”</p>

<p>“To you, Miss June!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;to me.” There was swift decision and the
fixing of the will. “I like it so much that I’ll give you
nineteen pounds for it, and that’s all I have in the
world.”</p>

<p>William was astonished.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t realised,” he said, in charmed surprise,
“that you admire it so much as all that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do admire it.” Her heart beat fast and high.
“And I want it. I can’t tell you just what that picture
means to me. But nineteen pounds is all I can pay.”</p>

<p>He shook his head in slow finality.</p>

<p>She did not try to conceal her disappointment.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think of taking a penny of your money,”
he said, shyly. “But as you love it so much, I hope
you will allow me to give it you.”</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp. An act of such pure generosity
was rather staggering.</p>

<p>“I hope you will, Miss June.” He spoke with a delicious
embarrassment. “Loving it so much really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
makes it yours. To love a thing is to possess it. And
I shall always have the happiness of feeling that it has
made you happy.”</p>

<p>She turned away a face glowing with shame. She
could never hope to feel about it in the way that he did,
and it seemed almost wicked to deceive him. But a
young man so poor as he could not afford to be so simple;
and she soothed her conscience by telling herself
what she was now doing was for his future good.</p>

<p>Conscience, however, was not to be put out of action
that way. The part she was playing hurt like a scald
on the hand. Both their tongues were tied by the pause
which followed, and then she said in a weak, halting
manner that was not like her: “You must have something
in exchange for it, of course&mdash;not that I shall
ever be able to offer anything near its true value.”</p>

<p>“I ask no more than what you have given me already.”</p>

<p>“What have I given you?”</p>

<p>“You have given me the wonderful look I see sometimes
in your face, and the light that springs from your
eyes and the glow of your hair. When you came to
this house, you brought something with you that was
never in it before.”</p>

<p>“How funny you are!” June’s cheek was a flame.
But he spoke so impersonally, delicately weighing each
word before a passion of sincerity gave it birth, that
any effective form of rebuke was out of the question.</p>

<p>“Miss June,” this amazing fellow went on, speaking
for all the world as if she were a picture whose signature
he was looking for, “when you came here, you
brought the sun of beauty. Colour and harmony and
grace, you brought those too. If only I knew how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
paint,”&mdash;he sighed gently,&mdash;“I could never rest until I
had put you on canvas just as you stand at this
moment.”</p>

<p>It was clear that he had forgotten completely that
this was the niece of his employer. She also forgot
that no young man had ventured yet to speak to her
like that. This was William the wonderful who was
addressing her, and his voice was music, his eyes slow
fire, his whole being a golden web of poetry and romance.</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to give away such a thing,” she
persisted, but with none of her usual force. “It’s
valuable; and I oughtn’t to take it.” The sound of
her voice, she knew only too well, was thin and
strange.</p>

<p>“Please, please take it, Miss June,” he quaintly entreated
her. “It will give me more pleasure to know
that you are caring for it, and that its beauty speaks to
you than if I kept it all to myself. I love it, but you
love it, too. If you’ll share the happiness it brings me,
then I shall love it even more.”</p>

<p>Shadows of the evening were now in the room. His
face was half hidden, and the wildness of her heart
scarcely allowed his voice to be heard. She thought
no longer of the worth of the gift, nor was she now
concerned with the propriety of its acceptance. Her
mind was in the grip of other things. Was it to herself
he was speaking? Or was he speaking merely
to a fellow worshipper of beauty? To such questions
there could be no answer; she trembled at the daring
which gave them birth.</p>

<p>His mere presence was a lure. She longed to touch
his hand very gently, and would perhaps have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
so, had she not been cruelly aware that even the hem of
her sleeve would defile it. She was cheating him, she
was cheating him outrageously. The only excuse she
had was that it was all for his own good; such, at least,
must now be her prayer, her hope, her faith.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> next morning Foxy Face, true to the appointment
he had made with S. Gedge Antiques, came
at ten o’clock with a friend. A quarter before that
hour William had been sent to the King’s Road, Chelsea,
in quest of a Jacobean carving-table for which
his master had a customer.</p>

<p>June, in anticipation of the event, took care to be
busy in a distant corner of the shop when these gentlemen
arrived. As on the occasion of Louis Quinze-legs’
previous visit, Uncle Si lost no time in going himself
to fetch the picture, but his prompt return was
fraught for June with bitter disappointment. By sheer
ill luck, as it seemed, his stern eye fell on her at the
very moment he gave the picture to Mr. Thornton’s
friend, a morose-looking man in a seedy frock coat
and a furry topper.</p>

<p>“Niece,” sharply called S. Gedge Antiques, “go and
do your dusting somewhere else.”</p>

<p>There was no help for it. June could almost have
shed tears of vexation, but she had to obey. The most
she dared venture in the way of appeasing a curiosity
that had grown terrific was to steal back on tiptoe a
few minutes later, to retrieve a pot of furniture polish
she had been clever enough to leave behind. Like a
mouse she crept back for it, but Uncle Si flashed upon
her such a truculent eye that, without trying to catch a
word that was passing, she simply fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Fear seized her. She felt sure that she had seen
the last of the picture. Her distrust of S. Gedge Antiques
had become so great that she was now convinced
that money would tempt him to anything. Twenty
miserable minutes she spent wondering what she must
do if the picture was disposed of there and then. She
tried to steel her heart against the fact, now looming
inevitable, that she would never see it again.</p>

<p>At last the visitors left the shop. June then discovered
that her fears had carried her rather too far,
and that for the time being, at any rate, Uncle Si had
been done an injustice.</p>

<p>He shambled slowly into the kitchen and to June’s
intense relief the picture was in his hand.</p>

<p>“Niece,” he said, threatfully; “understand once for
all that I won’t have you hanging about the shop when
I am doing business with important customers.”</p>

<p>The sight of the picture was so much more important
than the words which came out of his mouth that June
felt inclined to treat them lightly.</p>

<p>“I’m telling you,” said the old man fiercely. “Mark
what I say. I won’t have females listening with their
mouths open when I’m doing business. And don’t
laugh at me, else you’ll have to pack your box. Here!”
Uncle Si handed her the picture with a scowl. “Take
this back to where it came from; and just remember
what’s been said to you, or you’ll find yourself short
of a week’s pocket money.”</p>

<p>Adjured thus, June was a model of discretion for
the rest of that day; and yet she was the prey of a
devouring curiosity. She would have given much to
know what had taken place in the course of the morning’s
traffic with Louis Quinze-legs and his friend. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
was not until supper-time that she was able to gather
a clue, when Uncle Si mentioned the matter to William.
He was careful to do so, however, in the most casual
way.</p>

<p>“By the way, boy,” said the old man gravely balancing
a piece of cheese on the end of his knife, and fixing
June with his eye as he did so; “that daub of yours&mdash;I’ve
had Mr. Thornton here to look at it.”</p>

<p>“I hope he liked it, sir,” said William, with his eager
smile.</p>

<p>Uncle Si pursed his mouth. Then he went through
the rest of his performance, which on this occasion
ended in a noise through closed lips like a hornet’s
drone, which might have meant anything.</p>

<p>June felt an insane desire to give the old wretch a
punch on his long and wicked nose.</p>

<p>“What did he think of the cloud?” asked William.
“And the light of the sun striking through on to the
water?”</p>

<p>“He says it’s very rough and dirty, and in bad condition,
but if I could buy it for two pounds he might
be able to show me a small profit.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” murmured June, holding a glass
of water in suspense.</p>

<p>Uncle Si laid down his knife and looked at her.</p>

<p>“You <i>think</i> so, niece,” he snarled. “Have the goodness
to mind your own affairs, or you and I will quarrel.
That’s twice to-day I’ve had to speak to you.”</p>

<p>June covered a retreat from the impossible position
strong feelings had led her into by emptying her glass
in one fierce draught.</p>

<p>“You see, boy,” said Uncle Si, turning to William
with a confidential air, “this&mdash;this <i>picture</i>.”&mdash;It seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
a great concession on his part to allow that the thing
was a picture at all&mdash;“is without a signature. That
makes it almost valueless.”</p>

<p>William smiled and gently shook his head.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sir, but it is signed in every line.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish. No theorising&mdash;this is a business proposition.
And I tell you that without the signature, this
bit of pretty-pretty just amounts to nix.” The old man
gave his fingers a contemptuous snap. “That’s what
it amounts to. But as you’ve taken the trouble to bring
it all the way from Suffolk and you’ve spent a certain
amount of your master’s time in trying to get it clean,
as I say, I’ll spring a couple of pounds to encourage
you. But why I should I really don’t know.”</p>

<p>June was hard-set to refrain from breaking the peace
which followed, with the laugh of derision. Happily,
by a triumph of will power, she bridled her tongue and
kept her eyes modestly upon her plate.</p>

<p>“Now, boy!” Uncle Si made a series of conjuror’s
passes with his spectacles. “Two pounds! Take it
or leave it! What do you say?”</p>

<p>William did not say anything, yet one of his shy
smiles was winged to June across the table. She
promptly sent back a scowl quite feral in its truculence,
which yet was softened by a world of eloquence and
humour behind it. There was no other way of intimating
that Uncle Si must not learn too soon that the
picture was now hers.</p>

<p>William, no fool, if he chose to use his wits, was
able to interpret this wireless. Thus he began to temporise;
and he did so in a way delightfully his own.</p>

<p>“What difference, sir, do you think the signature
would make to our little masterpiece?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The old man gave his assistant a look almost superhuman
in its caution.</p>

<p>“Heh?” said he.</p>

<p>The question was repeated.</p>

<p>“Depends whose it is,” was the testy answer. “You
know that as well as I do. If it’s Hobbema’s, it might
be worth money.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Hobbema’s.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said S. Gedge Antiques. “Interesting to
know that.” Had he been on winking terms with his
niece, he would have winked at her; as it was, he had
to be content with a sarcastic glance at the tablecloth.
“But how do you know?” he added, idly careless.</p>

<p>“Anyone can see it isn’t.”</p>

<p>Anyone could not see it wasn’t a Hobbema, and that
was the snag in the mind of the old man at this moment.
Neither Mr. Thornton nor his friend, Mr. Finch, was
quite certain it was not a Hobbema; they were even
inclined to think that it was one, but in the absence of
proof they were not disposed to gamble upon it.</p>

<p>“How do you mean, boy, that anyone can see it
isn’t?”</p>

<p>“That gleam of sunlight, sir.” The voice of William
was music and poetry in the ear of June. “I doubt
whether even Hobbema could have painted that.”</p>

<p>“You tell that to the Marines,” said S. Gedge Antiques
impatiently. All the same he knew better than
to discourage William in the process of unbosoming
himself. The young man was continually betraying
such a knowledge of a difficult and abstruse subject that
it was becoming a source of wonder to his master.
“Maybe you’ve found somebody else’s signature?”
The tone was half a sneer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I rather think I have,” said William
quite calmly and simply.</p>

<p>“You have!” A sudden excitement fused the cold
voice. “When did you find it?”</p>

<p>“It would be about half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” said the old man.</p>

<p>This queer fellow’s casual tone was extremely puzzling.
Why should he be inclined to apologise for having
discovered the name of the artist, when it was of
such vital importance? The only possible explanation
of the mystery at once presented itself to the astute
mind which asked the question.</p>

<p>“Then I expect you’ve been a fool. If you couldn’t
find Hobbema’s signature you had no right to find the
signature of anyone else.”</p>

<p>William was out of his depth. He could only regard
his master with eyes of bewilderment. But June was
not out of hers; she was careful, all the same, not to
regard Uncle Si with eyes of any kind. She merely
regarded her plate. And as she did so, a little shiver
that was almost pain ran through her. Uncle Si was
such a deep one that she felt ashamed of knowing how
deep he was.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, sir,” said William, in the way
that only he could have spoken.</p>

<p>“Boy,” said his master, “you make me tired. In
some ways you are clever, but in others you are just
the biggest idiot that ever happened. I should have
thought a child would have known that this has either
got to be a Hobbema or it has got to be nothing. The
best thing you can do is to go upstairs right now and
take out that signature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“But I understood you to say, sir, that the picture
has no market value without a signature.”</p>

<p>“No more it has, you fool. But there may be those
who think it’s a Hobbema. And if there are, it is up
to us to help them to keep on thinking.”</p>

<p>June hung breathlessly on every word that passed.
She watched William shake his head in slow and grave
perplexity.</p>

<p>“But anybody can see that it isn’t a Hobbema.”</p>

<p>“Anybody can’t,” said the old man. “Mr. Thornton
can’t for one, and he’s a pretty good judge, as a rule.
Mr. Finch is more doubtful, but even he wouldn’t like
to swear to it.”</p>

<p>William shook his head.</p>

<p>“Boy, you are a fool. You are getting too clever;
you are getting above your trade. Go at once and take
out that signature, whatever it may be, provided it
isn’t Hobbema’s, and I’ll give you two pounds for the
thing as it stands. And let me tell you two pounds is
money.”</p>

<p>William shook his head a little more decisively.</p>

<p>“I’d have to paint out the trees,” he said, “and the
water, and that cloud, and that gleam of sunlight before
I could begin to touch the signature.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s a Van Roon,” said William, in a voice so gentle
that he might have been speaking to himself.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques laid his knife on his plate with a
clatter. He gave an excited snort. “Van Fiddlestick!”</p>

<p>William’s smile grew so intense that June could
hardly bear to look at him.</p>

<p>“Every inch of it,” said William, “and there are not
so many, is Van Roon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Why, there are only about a dozen Van Roons in
existence,” said the old man, a queer little shake coming
into his voice.</p>

<p>“There’s one more now, sir.” William’s own voice
was curiously soft.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“I</span>f</span> you go on like this,” said S. Gedge Antiques,
after a pause, full of drama, “you will have to
have a cold compress put on your head. Do you mean
to tell me you have actually found the signature?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said William, “right down in the corner
about half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you say so instead of keeping it
all to yourself?”</p>

<p>“Because it doesn’t seem half so important as the
other things I’ve found.”</p>

<p>“What other things?”</p>

<p>“The trees and the water and that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We’ve heard more than enough about those. Here
have you been rubbing for that signature for the best
part of a fortnight, and you pretend to have found a
Van Roon, and you keep it as close as the tomb.”</p>

<p>“I had found Van Roon, sir, long before I came upon
his name.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish! What do you know of Van Roon?”</p>

<p>“There is a Van Roon in the treasure house in the
Square,” said William with his inward smile.</p>

<p>“There’s only one,” snapped S. Gedge Antiques, “in
the treasure house in the Square, as you call it, and it’s
a very small one, too.”</p>

<p>“Ours is very small, sir. All Van Roons are small.
And they are very scarce.”</p>

<p>“They are so scarce, my friend, that you’ll never
convince anybody that ours is genuine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“There’s no need, sir, provided you know it is yourself.”</p>

<p>“But that’s just what I don’t know,” said the old
man. “Anyhow you had better go upstairs and fetch
it. I’ll have a look at the signature of Mynheer Van
Roon.” And then Uncle Si scowled at his niece who,
in a state of growing excitement, had already begun to
remove the bread and cheese from the supper table.</p>

<p>While the young man went up to the attic, his master
ruminated.</p>

<p>“Fellow’s cracked,” he declared, a hostile eye still
fixed upon June. “That’s his trouble. I’ll never be
able to make anything of him. This comes of Hobbemaising.
Van Fiddlestick!”</p>

<p>“Uncle Si,” said June, in the voice of a dove, “if
it is a Van Roon, what is the value of it?”</p>

<p>“Heh?” growled Uncle Si, and his eye became that
of a kite. “Never you mind. Get on with the clearing
of that table, and don’t interfere. I never knew such
creatures as women for minding other people’s business.
But I can tell you this, only a born fool would
talk of Van Roon.”</p>

<p>A born fool came down the stairs at that moment,
the picture in one hand, a microscope in the other.</p>

<p>“It’s not a very good light, sir&mdash;” William’s voice
trembled a little&mdash;“but I think if you hold it up to the
gas, you will be able to see the signature right down in
the corner. Just there, sir, along by my thumb.”</p>

<p>The old man, glass in hand, brought a close scrutiny
to bear upon the spot along by William’s thumb. Then
he shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, it is just as I thought. There doesn’t begin to
be the sign of a signature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you see the upstroke of the R?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I see the leg of my grandmother!”</p>

<p>“Just there, sir. Round by the edge of my finger
nail.”</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques solemnly exchanged his “selling”
spectacles for his “buying” ones, screwed up his
eyes and grunted: “Why, that’s the tail of a Q, you
fool.” Again he took up the microscope and made
prodigious play with it. “That’s if it’s anything.
Which I take leave to doubt.”</p>

<p>William, however, was not to be moved. And then
Uncle Si’s manner had a bad relapse. He began to
bully. William, all the same, stuck to his guns with a
gentle persistence that June could only admire. This
odd but charming fellow would have Van Roon, or he
would have none.</p>

<p>At last the old man laid the microscope on the supper
table, and there came into his cunning, greedy eyes
what June called the “old crocodile” look. “If you’ll
take my advice, boy, you’ll turn that R into an A, and
you’ll make that upstroke a bit longer, so that it can
stand for an H, and you’ll touch up those blurs in the
middle, so that ordinary common people will really be
able to see that it <i>is</i> a Hobbema. Now what do you
say?”</p>

<p>William shook a silent, rather mournful, head.</p>

<p>“If you’ll do that, you shall have five pounds for it.
That’s big money for a daub for which you paid five
shillings, but Mr. Thornton says American buyers are
in the market, and with Hobbemas in short supply, they
might fall for a thing like this. But of course the job
must be done well.”</p>

<p>William was still silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Now what do you say, boy?” The Old Crocodile
was unable to conceal his eagerness. “Shall we say
five pounds as it stands? We’ll leave out the question
of the signature. Mr. Thornton shall deal with that.
Now what do you say? Five pounds for it now?”</p>

<p>William did not speak. It was at the tip of June’s
tongue to relieve his embarrassment by claiming the
picture as her own; but, luckily, she remembered that
to do so just now might have an effect opposite to the
one intended. Even as it was, she could not refrain
from making a “mouth” at William to tell him to stand
firm.</p>

<p>He saw the “mouth,” but unfortunately so did Uncle
Si. There were few things escaped the old man when
he happened to be wearing his “buying” spectacles.</p>

<p>“Niece, you cut off to bed,” he said sternly. “And
you must learn not to butt in, or one of these days
you’ll bite granite.”</p>

<p>June showed no desire to obey, but Uncle Si, with
a look set and dour, shuffled as far as the parlour door
and opened it. “No more of it, my girl.” The voice
was full of menace.</p>

<p>One further instant June hesitated. The picture had
been given to her, and the right and proper course was
to claim it. But this daughter of the midlands was
afraid of a false move. The revelation sprang to the
tip of her tongue, yet a mysterious power seemed to
hold it back. She may have expected help from William,
but he, alas, seemed too much occupied in proving
his case to be able to give a moment’s thought to the
picture’s ownership.</p>

<p>“Off to bed with you.” The old man’s voice was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
now savage. “Or&mdash;!” There was a world of meaning
in the strangled threat.</p>

<p>June climbed up to her attic with the best grace she
could, her thunderbolt unlaunched. As slowly she
undressed by the uncertain light of one poor candle,
she felt very unhappy. Not only was there something
unpleasant, one might almost say wicked, about Uncle
Si, but his manner held a power of menace which fed
her growing fear.</p>

<p>What <i>was</i> there to be afraid of? As she blew out
the candle and leapt into the meagre, rickety bed which
had lumps in the middle, that was the question she put
to a rather stricken conscience. To ask the question
was not to answer it; a fact she learnt after she had
said her prayers in which Uncle Si was dutifully included.
Perhaps the root of the mischief was that the
old man was so horridly deceitful. While he held the
picture up to the light, and he gazed at it through the
microscope, she fancied that she had seen the devil
peeping out of him. In a vivid flash she had caught
the living image of the Hoodoo. And June was as
certain as that her pillow was hard, that cost what it
might he had made up his mind to get possession of the
treasure.</p>

<p>At the same time, she lacked the knowledge to enter
fully into the niceties of the case. The picture might
be a thing of great value; on the other hand it might
not. She was not in a position to know; yet she was
quite sure that William in spite of his cleverness was
in some ways a perfect gaby, and that his master was
out to take advantage of the fact.</p>

<p>As she sought in vain for a soft place in her comfortless
bed, she was inclined to admire her own astuteness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
in persuading William to bestow the picture upon
herself. It was for the Sawney’s own sake, that at
least was how she chose to view the transaction now.
But a sense of vague triumph was dashed by the
thought lurking at the back of her mind. Uncle Si
was bound to get the picture from the feckless William
somehow; indeed the young man, being as clay
in the hands of his master, she was soon besieged with
a fear that he had parted with it already.</p>

<p>The slow passing of the tardy minutes gave form
and pressure to this spectre. With an excitement that
grew and grew she listened intently for William ascending
to the room next door. Soon or late she would
hear his feet on the carpetless stairs; but to one burning
with impatience it seemed that an age had to pass.</p>

<p>At last came the sounds for which she was so expectantly
listening. The door of the next room was
softly closed. What had happened? Was the picture
still in his keeping? To lie all night with that question
unanswered was more than she could bear. Suddenly
she jumped out of bed, flung a macintosh over her
white nightdress, so that the proprieties might be observed,
thrust her feet into slippers and then knocked
upon William’s door.</p>

<p>It was opened at once.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss June!” Astonishment was in the tone.
“Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“The picture?” said June, in quick whisper, so that
Uncle Si should not hear. “You haven’t left it downstairs,
I hope?”</p>

<p>Laughing gently, William half turned from the
threshold and pointed to a small table in the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the room, on which lay the treasure with a bit of candle
burning beside it.</p>

<p>A deep sigh expressed June’s relief. “Please give it
to me. I will lock it up in my box for safety.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her eagerness, and declared that it
was quite all right where it was. Besides, another
week’s work was needed to give the last touches to the
delicate process of cleaning. June, whose careful bringing-up
would not allow her to enter the room in such
circumstances, tried from its threshold to make clear
that the picture was already clean enough for her. But
William was not to be moved. Many exquisite details yet
called for the labours of a true lover.</p>

<p>“Well, you must promise,” whispered June finally,
“to take <i>enormous</i> care of it. You must promise not
to let it out of your sight for a single moment.”</p>

<p>William hesitated to give this pledge. It appeared
that his master wanted to show the picture to a friend;
a fact which did but serve to confirm June in her suspicions.
But she had the wisdom not to put them into
words. She was content to affirm once more that the
picture was now hers and that she would not trust
<i>anyone</i> with a thing of such value.</p>

<p>“But I’d trust the master with my life,” said William
softly.</p>

<p>June felt that she would like to beat him for his
innocence, as her manner plainly showed. In some
things he was almost too simple to live.</p>

<p>Suddenly she gave him a stern good-night, and
abruptly closed the door. But it was long after Saint
Martin’s Church had struck the hour of two that sleep
visited her pillow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> next day was Saturday; and as the shop
closed at one, June prepared to keep her promise
of accompanying William to his “treasure house.”
Strategy was needed, all the same. After she had
washed up, she put on her “going out” dress. But when
she came downstairs in it, Uncle Si, who took a most
unwelcome interest in all her movements, inquired
what was in the wind.</p>

<p>“I’m going to look at a hat,” was the answer, bland
and cool.</p>

<p>“Going to look <i>at</i> a hat!” To the mind of Uncle Si
it was an unheard-of proceeding. “Next thing you’ll
be wanting to buy a hat.”</p>

<p>June confessed that it might be so.</p>

<p>“You’ve got one already, haven’t you? Besides, the
shops won’t be open.”</p>

<p>The good shops might not be open, June allowed.
But she was not seeking a good hat. The article to
which her fancy turned was for every-day use; yet
when all was said it was a mere blind. She did not
really intend to buy a hat, but she certainly meant if
possible, to throw dust in the eyes of the Old Crocodile.
Had he been able to guess that she was going with
William to the National Gallery he would have banned
the expedition.</p>

<p>In order to stand well with her conscience and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
be a story teller in the eyes of the world, June walked
as far as the Strand, and carefully inspected the window
of a cheap milliner’s. And then, as arranged, she
met William as the clocks were striking three at the
Charing Cross corner of Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>It was a glorious September afternoon. And for
June it was an exquisite if brief escape from servitude.
She had yet to see William apart from the shop, yet
now, as she came upon him standing by the post office,
she was quite struck by his appearance. Tall and slight
of form, he carried himself well, his neat suit of blue
serge, old though it was in the revealing light of the
sun, was brushed with scrupulous care, and his large
flowing tie which he had the art of tying in a way of
his own, made him look so interesting that June secretly
was rather proud of being seen in his company. For
undeniably he was handsome. In fact, standing there
straight, alert and smiling upon the world, he had a
look of mysterious charm which in the eye of one beholder
raised him above the run of men.</p>

<p>At the sight of June, he lifted his old straw hat with
a little air of homage, and also with a slight blush that
became him adorably. And in his mood there was a
poetry that delighted her, although she was careful
not to let him know it.</p>

<p>“How wonderful it all is!” He waved his hand
gaily to the sky. “And to think that every bit of it
belongs to you and me!”</p>

<p>June, as matter-of-fact a young woman as the city
of Blackhampton had ever produced, felt bound to ask
what William meant by this extravagant remark.
Charmed she was, and yet she was a little scandalised
too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“Beauty, beauty everywhere,” said the young man,
letting his voice take its delicious fall. “There was an
old Frenchman who said, that to see Beauty is to possess
it. Look, Miss June, at that marvellous blue, and
those wonderful, wonderful clouds that even Van Roon
himself could hardly have painted. It is all ours, you
know, all for our enjoyment, all for you and me.”</p>

<p>“But you are speaking of the world, aren’t you?”
There was a slight note of protest in June’s solemn tone.</p>

<p>“If you fall in love with beauty, all the world is
yours. There’s no escape from beauty so long as the
sky is above us. No matter where we walk we are
face to face with beauty.”</p>

<p>June was afraid that a girl who looked so smart in
a lilac silk dress and a picture hat that she had the
air of a fashion plate must have caught William’s injudicious
observation. At any rate, she smiled at him
as they passed. But then arose the question, had he
not first smiled at her? Certainly, to be up against that
intriguing frock, to say nothing of the hat, must have
meant rare provocation for such an out-and-out lover
of the ornamental.</p>

<p>Miss Grandeur, no doubt, had caught the look in his
eyes which a minute ago June herself had surprised
there. He simply could not help paying tribute to such
radiance.</p>

<p>But was the girl beautiful? There was no doubt
that William thought so. Still, the worst of it was
that in his eyes everything under the sun was beautiful.</p>

<p>“She’d be nothing at all if it were not for the money
she spends on herself,” June remarked, with more
severity than relevance.</p>

<p>All the same it was a rare experience to walk abroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
with William. He had an eye for all things and in
all things he found the thing he sought.</p>

<p>On the steps of the National Gallery was a majestic
policeman. To June he was but an ordinary symbol
of the law, but for William he had a different message.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir!”</p>

<p>At the compliment of this unwonted style of address,
Constable X drew himself up, and returned the greeting
with a proud smile.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how grateful we are to you,” said
William, “for taking such care of our treasures.”</p>

<p>The policeman seemed rather amused. “It’s my job,”
he said, training, at the same time, upon June an eye
of quizzical intelligence. It was odd, yet all in a moment
Constable X had ceased to be a stern-looking
fellow.</p>

<p>As soon as William crossed the threshold of his
treasure house, a kind of rapture came upon him. His
voice grew hushed. And to June it seemed doubtful
whether he would ever get beyond the Hermes on the
main staircase. Once within this palace of many enchantments,
he began to lose all sense of time and
place; and, in spite of the fact that he was the soul of
chivalry, he even seemed in danger of forgetting that
he was accompanied by a lady.</p>

<p>Troubled at last by the silence of her escort, June
gently observed: “This place seems nearly as big as
the Blackhampton Art Museum.”</p>

<p>To William’s fine perception it was a delicate reminder
that art is eternal, and that in the month of September
the National Gallery closes at six.</p>

<p>The young man sighed deeply and turned away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the Hermes. Up the main staircase they walked side
by side.</p>

<p>“Keep straight on, Miss June. If we glance to the
right or the left, we may not get to the Van Roon before
next Saturday.”</p>

<p>“We!” was June’s thought. “Better speak for yourself.
In the Blackhampton Art Museum we have things
far nicer than a few old chipped statues.” Happily, for
the time being at least, it remained a thought without
words.</p>

<p>They went through a room on the right, and then
into an inner room. June was led to its farthest corner,
and proudly marshalled into the presence of an object
so small, and so insignificant, that she felt it was
really surprising that even William should attach the
least importance to it.</p>

<p>However, a mere glance proved that it was not so
surprising after all. The picture contained a cloud,
a tree, some water and a windmill. And these objects
in themselves so trivial, yet sufficed, as June had learned
already, to raise William at any time to the seventh
heaven of bliss.</p>

<p>A moment’s inspection of the picture was enough for
June. To her mind the work was quite commonplace.
Yet William stood in front of it in an attitude of silent
adoration, his head a little to one side, and apparently
holding his breath for such a long period that June began
to wonder how the trick was done. She was bound
in honour to share this silent ecstasy, but having varied
the proceedings a little by standing first on her right
foot, and then on her left, she decided at last to throw
up her part.</p>

<p>Very gently she put an end to William’s reverie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“I think I will sit down,” said June.</p>

<p>“Please, please do!” The queer fellow came back
with a start to the world of reality. “Let us sit over
there on the corner of that sofa. Perhaps we may be
able to see it even better then than we do now.”</p>

<p>To the sofa they went accordingly and to June’s discomfiture
her mentor was at pains to dispose them both
in a way that should enable them to keep the picture in
their eye. June had no wish to keep the picture in her
eye. She had had more than enough of it already.
Besides, the large room was full of things vastly more
imposing, much better worth looking at. But William,
even seated on the sofa by her side, was still in thrall
to this remarkable work.</p>

<p>There is no saying how long June’s trial would have
lasted, but after it had gone on for a length of time
that began to seem interminable, it came to an end in
the most abrupt and dramatic way. Without any
kind of warning, a strange appearance swam into their
ken. Uncle Si, looking spruce and businesslike, and
much better dressed than usual, entered the room
through the door behind them.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> held her breath, while S. Gedge Antiques with
thought for nothing save the object that had
brought him there, made a bee-line for the picture at
which William was still solemnly staring. The old
man put on his spectacles. Whether they were his
“buying” or his “selling” ones, June was unable to
decide, but whichever they might be they had an important
function to perform. Uncle Si’s long and foxlike
nose bent so close to the paint that it might have
been smelling it.</p>

<p>June’s instinct was to flee before they were discovered.
And perhaps she would have urged this
course upon William had not pride said no. She was
in mortal fear of the old man, yet she despised herself
for that emotion. After all, they were doing no wrong
in spending Saturday afternoon in such a very elevated
form of amusement. Surely it devolved upon her to
stand up to this tyrant.</p>

<p>William, for his part, was without misgiving.
Thinking evil of none, least of all his master, he was
a little awed by that odd arrival, and yet he was unfeignedly
glad of his presence. The simpleton regarded
it as a compliment to himself that S. Gedge
Antiques should take the trouble to come in his own
person to look at the Van Roon.</p>

<p>At last S. Gedge Antiques turned away from the
Van Roon, and little suspecting who were so near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
to him, came full upon William and June seated together
upon the adjacent sofa. For a moment it was
as if a feather would have knocked him down. He
could trust his eyes so little that he hastily changed
his spectacles.</p>

<p>“What!” His brow was thunder. “You! Here!”</p>

<p>June, ready to carry the war into the country of the
enemy, was prepared to offer a cool “Why not?”
Happily, a second and wiser thought led her to await
developments. Secretly, Uncle Si was in a pretty rage
as June could tell by the look of him. But he was
not one to let his feelings override his judgment.
Whatever they were, they could keep. He had come
there for a particular purpose; this afternoon he was
bent on business only.</p>

<p>In the rasping voice which made June think of a
file and sandpaper, S. Gedge Antiques remarked: “Still
Hobbemaising, eh?”</p>

<p>William modestly admitted that he hoped Miss June
would have a look at The Avenue.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope she’ll be the better for it.” The old man
did his best to be polite. “It will improve her mind, no
doubt.”</p>

<p>“But we have come to see the Van Roon, sir,” said
William impulsively.</p>

<p>“Oh, you have.” There was a sudden narrowing of
foxy eyes. “Seems to me, boy, you’ve got Van Roon
on the brain.”</p>

<p>William could not help laughing at his master’s tone
of playfulness, but June did not laugh. She knew but
too well that as far as Uncle Si was concerned, Van
Roon was an exceedingly serious matter.</p>

<p>“You are wise, boy”&mdash;the old man tried very hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
to keep the sneer out of his voice&mdash;“to come and find
out what a Van Roon really looks like.”</p>

<p>William modestly said that he thought he knew that
already.</p>

<p>His master shook the head of wisdom. “Judging
by the way you’ve been going on lately I take leave to
doubt it. If you can trace the slightest resemblance to
that thing of ours”&mdash;as Uncle Si half turned to point
to the picture, June noticed that he was careful to say
“ours”&mdash;“I’m afraid, boy, you’re qualifying for Colney
Hatch.”</p>

<p>William laughed gaily at his master’s humour. He
felt bound in honour to do so, since the jokes from that
quarter were thin and few. But June did not laugh.
Something cold, subtle, deadly, was creeping into her
heart.</p>

<p>The old fox struck an attitude before the Van Roon.
“How a man who has his wits can compare that daub
of ours with this acknowledged masterpiece passes me
altogether.”</p>

<p>As a fact, William had not exactly compared his
Crowdham Market purchase with Number 2020 in the
official catalogue. He had merely affirmed that it was
by the same hand.</p>

<p>June was privileged to hear great argument. And
as at her birth a kind fairy had bestowed the gift
of penetration upon her, she listened to all that passed
with a fixity of mind that was almost painful. Carefully
weighing the pros and the cons as they were
advanced, she was fully determined to get a real insight
into the merits of a most singular and perplexing
matter.</p>

<p>Who was in the right? It was the opinion of William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
against the opinion of Uncle Si. From the first
she had had horrid doubts of the old man’s sincerity,
yet she must not prejudge so grave an issue. Account
must be taken, moreover, of the entire range of William’s
fantastic ideas. The thought was not pleasant,
but on the face of it, Uncle Si was likely to be far the
safer guide of the two.</p>

<p>As June listened, however, to the wheedling sneers
of the one and the forthright tone of the other, almost
too transparent in its honesty, she could only conclude
that Uncle Si was deliberately cheapening William’s
discovery for purposes of his own.</p>

<p>Looking at the masterpiece on the opposite wall, with
what June was only too keenly aware were the eyes
of ignorance, it was impossible to deny an extraordinary
similarity of subject and treatment. And this,
as she perceived at once, was where Uncle Si overdid
it. He would not allow that to the vision of a technical
expert, the possession of which he did not scruple
now to claim for himself, there was the slightest resemblance.
Such similarities as might exist on the
surface to delude the untutored eye he explained away
in a flood of words whose force was intended to convince
them both. But he convinced neither. June,
pinning her wits to a plain argument, smiled secretly
as more than once he contradicted himself. William
on the other hand, was not permitted by the love and
reverence he bore his master, to submit his speeches
to the scale. He took his stand upon the divine
instinct that was his by right of birth. Such being the
case he could but gently dissent from the old man. It
was one of his peculiarities that the surer he was, the
more gentle he grew. And therein, as June perceived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
he differed strangely from Uncle Si who could only
render conviction in terms of vehemence.</p>

<p>Finally, as a clincher, S. Gedge Antiques growled:
“Boy, you talk like a fool!” and head in air, marched
with the aid of his knobby walking stick out of
William’s treasure house.</p>

<p>William and June having stood to talk with the old
man, now sat down again.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness he’s gone!” said June.</p>

<p>William confessed that the master had puzzled him
considerably.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t like him to close his eyes to the facts of a
case. I can’t think what has happened to the master.
He hardly ever makes a mistake.”</p>

<p>Said June sagaciously: “Uncle Si being so wise about
most things, isn’t it likely that the mistake is yours?”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” William allowed. But at once he
added, with a divine simplicity: “I will stake my life,
all the same, Miss June, that our picture is a Van
Roon.”</p>

<p>“Or a clever forgery, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“No, no. As sure as you and I sit here, only one
hand painted that little thing of ours.”</p>

<p>“Then why should Uncle Si declare that it doesn’t in
the least resemble a Van Roon?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that I don’t know. It is very strange that he
should be so blind to the truth. As I say, it is the first
time I have known it to happen.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” said June, “that this is the first time
there has been so much money in the case.”</p>

<p>William dissented gravely. “The master would
never let money influence him in a matter of this kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Uncle Si lets money influence him in matters of
every kind.”</p>

<p>William shook his head. “I am afraid you don’t
quite understand the master,” he said, with a wonderful
look in his deep eyes.</p>

<p>June was too wise to contest the point. He might
know more about pictures than did she, but when it
came to human nature it was another pair of shoes.
It made her quite hot with anger to feel how easily
he could be taken in.</p>

<p>Sitting by William’s side on the edge of the sofa
she made a vow. From now on it should be her aim
in life to see that Uncle Si did not get the better of
this young man. She had made a good and wise beginning
by inducing him to bestow the picture upon
herself, instead of giving it, as so easily might have
happened, to the Old Crocodile. She knew that some
bad quarters of an hour lay ahead, in the course of
which she and her box might easily find themselves in
the street; but come what might, let her cherish that
picture as if it were life itself. For she saw with a
startling clearness that William’s future, and perhaps
her own, was bound up in its fortunes.</p>

<p>This surmise as to trouble ahead was borne out very
exactly by events. When accompanied by William she
returned to tea in a state as near positive happiness as
she had ever known, Uncle Si’s aspect was so hostile
that it would not have been surprising had she been
sent packing there and then. The presence of William
helped to restrain the anger of S. Gedge Antiques,
since there was more to lose than to gain just now by
fixing a quarrel upon him; but it was clear that the old
man did not intend to pass over the incident lightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Niece,” he began the moment his cup had been
handed to him, “kindly tell me what you mean by
gallivanting about London.”</p>

<p>A hot flame of resentment ran in June’s cheek. But
she was too proud to express it otherwise than by
rather elaborately holding her peace. She continued to
pour out tea just as if not a word had been said on the
subject.</p>

<p>“It’s my fault, sir,” said William, stepping into the
breach chivalrously, but with an absence of tact. “Miss
June very kindly consented to come and look at the
Van Roon.”</p>

<p>“There must be no more of it.” Miss June received
the full benefit of a north eye. “I will not have you
going about with a young man, least of all a young man
earning fifteen shillings a week in my employ.”</p>

<p>It was now the turn of William’s cheek to feel the
flame, but it was not in his nature to fight over a thing
of that kind, even had he been in a position to do so.
Besides, it hardly needed his master to tell him that he
had been guilty of presumption.</p>

<p>Indeed, the circumstances of the case made it almost
impossible for either of the culprits to defend such
conduct in the other’s presence. Yet June, to the intense
astonishment of Uncle Si, and no doubt to her
own, contrived to give battle in hostile territory.</p>

<p>“I can only say,” she remarked, with a fearlessness
so amazing that Uncle Si scalded his mouth by drinking
out of his cup instead of out of his saucer, “that if
fifteen shillings a week is all that William gets, it is
just about time he had a rise in his wages.”</p>

<p>For a moment Uncle Si could only splutter. Then
he took off his spectacles and wiped them fiercely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“Gracious goodness me! God bless my body and my
soul!” June would not have been at all surprised had
the old slave-driver “thrown a fit.”</p>

<p>“William is very clever,” she said undaunted.</p>

<p>“Niece, hold your tongue.” The words came through
clenched teeth. “And understand, once for all, that
I’ll have no more carryings-on. If you don’t look out,
you’ll find your box in the street.”</p>

<p>Having put June out of action, the old man turned
his attention to William. But with him he walked
more delicately. There must be no more Van Rooning,
but the ukase was given in a tone so oily that June
just had to smile.</p>

<p>In spite of his own edict, however, it was clear that
Van Roon continued much in the mind of William’s
master. The next day, Sunday, instead of taking the
air of the west central postal district, his custom as
a rule, when the forenoon was fine, he spent most of
the morning with the young man in the studio. June
felt this boded so ill that she went about her household
chores in a fever of anxiety. She was sure that Uncle
Si had fully made up his mind to have the picture; he
meant, also, to have it at his own price. However, she
had fully made up hers that this tragedy simply must
not occur.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span>, preparing for dinner a Yorkshire pudding,
brought an acute mind to bear on the still graver
problem before it. What would happen when Uncle
Si found out that William had been persuaded to give
her the picture? It was a question she was bound to
ask, yet she dare not foretell the answer. William and
she were completely in his power. Wholly dependent
upon the food and lodging the old man provided and
the few shillings a week with which he grudgingly
supplemented them, they could not afford to come to
an open breach with him; at the same time to June’s
practical mind, it would be an act of sheer madness to
give up the rare thing that fortune had put into their
hands.</p>

<p>Her need just then was the advice of some able and
disinterested friend. There was only her power of
putting two and two together to tell her that the picture
might be worth a large sum. And even that did not
allow her to know for certain; she must find a means
of making sure. Unhappily, there was not one person
in the world to whom she could turn for advice, unless
it was William himself; and in plain matters of business
he seemed so hopelessly at sea&mdash;if they involved dealings
with his master at all events&mdash;that June was convinced
he would be no use at all.</p>

<p>Beating up an egg for the Yorkshire pudding, she
felt a deep concern for what was now taking place up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
that second pair of stairs in the garret next the tiles.
Vainly she wished that she had had the sense to ask
William to keep back as long as possible the fact that
he had given the picture to her. But the mere request
would have opened the door to another anxiety. If
the picture was what he thought it was, could such a
gift, made in such circumstances, be regarded as irrevocable?
That must be left to the giver himself to decide:
assuming the simpleton had enough strength of mind
to prevent Uncle Si deciding it for him.</p>

<p>The pudding was just ready for the oven when she
heard Uncle Si come downstairs. He went into the
parlour, where every Sunday morning, with the help
of the <i>Exchange and Mart</i> and half an ounce of shag,
he spent an hour in meditation. As soon as the door
closed upon the old man, June ran attic-wards to confer
with William.</p>

<p>There was no beating about the bush. Bursting in
upon him breathlessly, she cried: “I hope you have not
told Uncle Si the picture is mine. I had meant to warn
you not to do so on any account&mdash;not for the present,
at least.”</p>

<p>William looked up from the treasure with his absorbed air;
but it appeared that as yet he had not let
the cat out of the bag.</p>

<p>“I am very glad.” June breathed freely again.</p>

<p>“I thought,” said William sadly, “it would be best
not to tell the master until after his dinner. But I fear
that whenever he knows it will upset him terribly.”</p>

<p>“Why should it?”</p>

<p>“It’s like this, Miss June&mdash;the master is fairly setting
his heart upon this picture.”</p>

<p>“Then he’d better unset it,” said June harshly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Trouble came unmistakably into the expressive face
of the picture’s late owner.</p>

<p>“I am afraid it will be quite a blow to him if he
doesn’t get this beautiful thing,” he said, gazing affectionately
at what he held in his hand.</p>

<p>“And yet he thinks so little of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! Not now. This morning after a careful
examination he’s changed his mind.”</p>

<p>June was not impressed by this face-about on the
part of S. Gedge Antiques. “If you ask me,” she
declared scornfully, “he changed his mind some time
ago. But he’s a bit too artful to let you know that.”</p>

<p>“But why?” said William perplexedly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that he thinks the more he cheapens
it the easier it will be to get it from you?”</p>

<p>William could not bring himself to take so harsh a
view.</p>

<p>“What does he offer for it now?” the new owner of
the Van Roon sternly inquired.</p>

<p>“You are not fair to the dear old master, believe me,
Miss June.” The young man spoke with charming
earnestness. “He has such a reverence for beauty that
he cannot reckon it in terms of money. This morning
I have brought him to see with my eyes.” Pride and
affection deepened in the voice of the simpleton. “He
has now such a regard for this lovely thing that he will
not be happy until he possesses it, and I shall not be
happy until you have given it to him.”</p>

<p>June was simply aghast.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but it was given to me!”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;I know.” The giver was pink with confusion.
“But you see, Miss June, your uncle has quite
set his heart on it. And I am wondering if you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
return it to me, so that I may offer it to him, as a
token of my love. No one could have had a better
or kinder master. I owe everything to him.” Suddenly,
however, the young man was aware of her dismay.
“I do hope you will not mind too much,” he said,
anxiously. “If you will allow me, I will give you something
else.”</p>

<p>June averted her eyes. “You gave me this. And
you can’t believe how much it means to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you have a great feeling for it. To
part with it will hurt you, I can see that. But please
think of the dear old master’s disappointment if he
doesn’t get it.”</p>

<p>“He merely wants it to sell again.”</p>

<p>“You are unjust to yourself, Miss June, in thinking
so. Money does not enter into your feeling about this
beautiful thing; it doesn’t enter into mine. Why should
it enter into the master’s, whose love of art is so intense?”</p>

<p>“Because his love of money is intenser. It’s his
ruling passion. Where are your eyes that they can’t
see a thing as plain as that?”</p>

<p>She must be as gentle as she could with this absurd
fellow, yet she feared that such words must cause a
wound. And the wound was wilfully dealt. It was so
important that he should be made to see the whole thing
as really and truly it was. But her hope was slight that
he would ever be brought to do so.</p>

<p>“I beg you,” he said, almost with passion, “to let
me have it back, so that I may give it to the dear old
master.”</p>

<p>“It is madness,” said June bitterly. “He has no true
feeling for the picture at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>She saw that her words were unwise. They made
her own position worse. But faced by such an appeal
she had to do her best on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>“I know how much it means to you.” Pain was
clouding the eyes of this dreamer. “I know your love
for it is equal to mine, but that will make our joy in
giving it to your uncle so much the greater.”</p>

<p>“But why to Uncle Si&mdash;of all people?”</p>

<p>“He wants it.” William’s voice was low and solemn.
“At this moment, I believe he wants it more than anything
else in the world.”</p>

<p>June said with scorn: “He wants it as much as he
wants a thousand pounds. And he doesn’t want it
more. I believe money is his god. Think of the fifteen
shilling he pays you a week. It makes my blood boil.”</p>

<p>A quick flush sprang to the young man’s cheek.
“Money has nothing to do with this, Miss June.”</p>

<p>“It has to do with everything.”</p>

<p>Delicately he ventured to contradict. “Where love
is, money doesn’t come in. I simply want to offer this
priceless thing to the old master out of a full heart, as
you might say.”</p>

<p>“Then you shouldn’t have parted with it.” She hated
herself for her words, but she was not in a mood to
soften them. “You have already had the pleasure of
giving it to me, therefore it is only right that you should
now deny yourself the pleasure of giving it to Uncle
Si. It is like eating your cake and having it.”</p>

<p>William was not apt in argument, and this was cogent
reasoning. He lacked the wit to meet it, yet he
stuck tenaciously to his guns. “When you realize what
this rare treasure means to the old man, I’m sure you’ll
change your mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>June shook her head. Secretly, however, she felt
like weakening a bit. In the wistful voice was a note
that hurt. But she could not afford to yield; there
was far too much at stake. “I shall have to think the
matter over very carefully,” she temporised. “And,
in the meantime, not a word to Uncle Si that the picture’s
mine.”</p>

<p>She mustered the force of will to exact a promise.
Bewildered, sad, a little incredulous, he gave it.</p>

<p>“<i>I hope he doesn’t hate me half as much as I hate
myself</i>,” was the swift and sickening thought that
annihilated June, as she ran from the studio, having
recollected with a pang of dismay that she had not put
in the pudding for dinner.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>inner</span> was a miserable meal. The Yorkshire
pudding was light, the roast sirloin was done to a turn, the potatoes were white and floury, the kidney
beans were tender, but June could find nothing in the
way of appetite. The mere presence of William at the
other side of the table was almost more than she could
bear. So keen was her sense of a terribly false position
that she dare not look at him. What did he think
of her? How must she appear to one all high-minded
goodness and generosity?</p>

<p>Surely he must know, after what had just passed,
that her love of the picture was mere base deceit.
Surely he must hold such an opinion of her now that
he would never believe or trust her again. And the
tragedy of it was that she could not hope to make him
see the real motive which lay behind it all.</p>

<p>Seated at the table, making only a pretence of eating,
but listening with growing anger and disgust to the
artful change she now detected in the tone of Uncle
Si, it was as if the chair in which she sat was poised
on the edge of an abyss. William must despise her
quite as much as she despised the Old Crocodile, was
the thought which turned her heart to stone.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques having had the wit to discover
the set of the wind, had begun most successfully to
trim his sails. An hour’s careful examination of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
picture that morning had convinced him that he had
underrated its merits. There was very good work in
it, and as a lifelong lover of art&mdash;with a devout glance
at William&mdash;good work always appealed to him. But
whether the thing, as a whole, was to be rated as highly
as William put it, was decidedly an open question.
Still the picture had merit, and personally he should
treasure it as much for William’s sake as for its own.</p>

<p>June realized that it was now the turn of this cunning
old fox to make love to the Van Roon’s owner.
But was he cunninger than she? Yet what concerned
her more than anything just now was the plain fact that
he had already managed to persuade himself that the
treasure was his property.</p>

<p>This was not the hour to disabuse his mind. And no
matter when that hour came she foresaw a dire quarrel.
She was now involved in a business to strain all the
resources of her diplomacy. But William needed help.
Cost what it might the task devolved upon her of looking
after his affairs.</p>

<p>William, meanwhile, in his own peculiar way, seemed
not averse from looking after hers. After dinner her
first duty was to clear the table and wash up; and he
simply insisted upon bearing a hand. He carried the
tray into the back kitchen, and then, almost with defiance,
presided at the washing of the crockery, while she
had to be content with the humbler office of drying it.</p>

<p>“It’s your hands I’m thinking of, Miss June.”</p>

<p>“My hands are no affair of yours,” was the terse
reply.</p>

<p>The lover of beauty shyly declared that such hands
were not meant for such a task.</p>

<p>“Nothing to write home about&mdash;my hands aren’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>Politely sceptical, William drew from his pocket a
bit of pumice stone.</p>

<p>“It is to take the soils out of your fingers,” he said,
offering this talisman shyly.</p>

<p>June’s face was now a tawny scarlet. She did not
know whether to laugh or to be angry. Yet how was
it possible to be angry with a creature who was so
charmingly absurd?</p>

<p>“May I take them out for you?”</p>

<p>The answer was “no.”</p>

<p>But somehow her face must have said “yes.” For
without more ado, the amazing fellow took one of her
hands and with nice discretion began to apply the
pumice stone.</p>

<p>“There, now,” he said finally.</p>

<p>A stern rebuke trembled upon her lips, yet with the
best will in the world it could not find a form of words
whereby to get itself uttered.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span> little</span> later in the day Uncle Si came into the
back kitchen where June was at work. It seemed
that he had an announcement to make.</p>

<p>“Niece, there’s a piece of news for you. I’ve decided
to take Mrs. Runciman back.”</p>

<p>June saw no reason why Mrs. Runciman should not
be taken back. Indeed, she would welcome the return
of the charwoman. It would certainly reduce the
burden of her own labours which was by no means
light.</p>

<p>“You and I are not going to hit it off, I can see that.
Already there’s been too much of your interference.
Next thing you’ll upset that boy. And I wouldn’t have
that happen&mdash;not for a thousand pounds. So I think
the best thing I can do is to take Mrs. Runciman back,
and get her to find you a job.”</p>

<p>“For me!” said June slowly. “Mrs. Runciman find
a job for me!”</p>

<p>“If she comes you’ll have to go. I can’t afford
to keep a couple o’ women eating their heads off. The
times don’t run to it.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a job do you expect a charwoman
to find for me?” June asked, biting her lip.</p>

<p>“She may know of somebody who wants a domestic
help. As far as I can see, you are not fitted for anything
else.”</p>

<p>That was true enough, as June felt with a sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
pang. She was a girl without any sort of training except
in the tedium of housework. No other career was
open to her and she was going to be turned adrift.
There came a hot flame to her cheeks, a sting of quick
tears to her eyes. She was a proud and ambitious
girl; never had she felt so keenly humiliated.</p>

<p>“If you stay here,” said Uncle Si, “you’re sure to
upset that boy. And, as I say, rather than that should
happen I’d pay a thousand pounds to a hospital.”</p>

<p>June didn’t reply. But in a surge of feeling she
went up to her attic, and with rage in her heart flung
herself full length on the bed.</p>

<p>The blow was fully expected, yet that hardly made
the weight of it less. Soon or late this miser was
bound to turn her out of doors; yet coming at such a
time “the sack” was in the nature of a calamity.</p>

<p>Well, she must face it! Domestic service was the
only thing to which she could turn her hand, and that,
she foresaw, was likely to prove a form of slavery. A
future, hard, confined and miserable, lay in front of
her.</p>

<p>Bitterly she regretted now that she had not been able
to fit herself for some other way of life. She had had
a reasonably good education, as far as it went, in her
native town of Blackhampton, where her father at
one time had been in a moderately good position. But
he had died when she was fourteen. And her mother,
with health completely broken several years before her
death had been left so badly off that June, perforce, had
to give up all thoughts of a wider field. Stifling vague
ambitions, she had bravely submitted to the yoke but,
in spite of a sense of duty honestly, even nobly done,
the sequel was a grim distaste of household drudgery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
And this had not been made less by a month under the
roof of S. Gedge Antiques.</p>

<p>With a gnawing sense of misery that was like a
toothache, June slid off the bed and looked at herself
in the cracked mirror which adorned the crazy dressing-table.
Her only assets were comprised in her personal appearance.
Instinctively she took stock of them.
Alas, as she beheld them now, they were pretty much
a “washout.”</p>

<p>First to strike her was the tell-tale redness of her
eyelids, and that disgusted her to begin with. But,
apart from that, she felt in her own mind that her personality
was not really attractive. Her education was
small, her life had been restricted and narrow; and now
there seemed no way out.</p>

<p>Honestly she was not pretty, she was not clever, and
she knew next to nothing of the world. Even at Blackhampton,
where the supply of smart girls was strictly
limited, she had never passed for anything out of the
common. She had felt sometimes that her nature was
too serious. In a girl a serious nature was a handicap,
she had once heard Mr. Boultby, the druggist at the
corner of Curzon Street, remark. One “asset,” however,
she certainly had. The mop of golden-brown
hair had always been her stand-by, and Mr. Boultby,
that man of the world, had paid her compliments upon
it. An artist would revel in it, he had said. Certainly
there was a lot of it, and the colour having aroused
comment even in her early days at the High School
among her form-mates, it was no doubt rather striking.
She was also inclined to be tall and long in the
leg, she knew that her shoulders and chest were good,
she prided herself upon the neatness of her ankles, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
at the back of her shrewd mind lurked the fear that
the general effect must be plainness, not beauty. She
had heard Mr. Boultby, always a friend, describe her
as “unusual,” but she had felt that it was his polite way
of saying she was not so good-looking as she might be.</p>

<p>No, wherever her fortune might lie, it was not in
her face. Once or twice, in her romantic Blackhampton
phases, which at best were very brief and few,
she had thought of the stage. But one month of London
had convinced her that it was not her line. Considering
her inexperience of life her fund of horse
sense was rather remarkable. She was a great believer
in the doctrine of “looking facts in the face.”
And the fact she had to meet now was that she was not
in any way pretty or talented. Unless you were one
or the other, and London teemed with girls who were
both, the doors of the theatre were locked and barred.</p>

<p>Back on the edge of the bed, she began to consider
the question of learning shorthand and typing, so that
she might become a clerk in an office. But her means
were so scant that the plan was hardly feasible. Really
it seemed that no career was open to her, other than
the one she loathed. And then the thought of William
came. At once, by a strange magic, it eased the pressure.
Heart, brain and will were merged in an immediate task;
she must stand between this child of
nature and the avarice of his master.</p>

<p>The sudden thought of William brought courage,
tenacity, fighting power. She knew that at this moment
he was the other side the wall. An impelling need
urged her to go to him. Forgetful of red and swollen
lids she got up at once and went and knocked on the
studio door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>A familiar voice said, “Come in!”</p>

<p>William, as usual in that room, was pottering about
amid oils, canvasses and varnish. He was in shirt
sleeves, he wore a large apron, his shock of fair hair,
which gave him the look of a poet, was rumpled, there
was a smudge on his cheek, but the absorption of his
eyes, their look of intensity, half filled her with awe.</p>

<p>She had really come to tell him that she was going
to be sent away. But as soon as she found herself in
his presence she was overcome by sheer pride. From
the first this young man had treated her with a deference
which implied that she was of a clay superior
to his own. His bearing towards her always stressed
the fact that she was the niece of his good master, and
that he was a servant humbly grateful for his fifteen
shillings a week.</p>

<p>At first this attitude had fed her vanity in a subtle
way. But now, in present circumstances, it seemed
almost to enrage her. It was quite absurd that a man
of such distinguished talent should place her upon a
pedestal. The truth of the matter was she was unfit
to lace his shoes, and it was amazing that he did not
know it.</p>

<p>Upon her entrance William had immediately risen
from his stool, and had bowed slightly over the pot of
varnish he held in his hand, with a half-humorous
air of homage, as some famous chemist might have
done when disturbed by a great lady in the midst of
his wonderful researches. “I know it’s not me you
have come to see,” his gentle manner seemed to say;
“it is this marvellous thing on the easel at my elbow.”</p>

<p>All the same it was William she had come to see.
She had come to him for countenance and sympathy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
And it did not help her at all that she should be treated
with a shy reserve. She craved to be told that she had
come to mean something to him; she craved to be told
that his fastidious concern for her hands, and the
regard he had for a beauty in which she herself did
not believe was more than mere chivalry towards women
in general. Alas, in spite of the eager friendliness
of her reception this was not apparent. In the eyes of
William she was just the master’s niece, and the incident
of the pumice stone was without significance, beyond
the fact that he was no more than the least of
her servants.</p>

<p>It was very exasperating.</p>

<p>“But if you are wise,” said a voice within, “you
will not let this Gaby know that you think so.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVII">XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> spent a worried and disconsolate night. She
had very little sleep. Time and again she listened
to the melancholy drip-drip of rain on the eaves just
over her head. Never in her life had she felt so
wretched. She was horribly lonely, without resources
or friends. How she was to live through the endless
years of servitude and dependence on the will of others
that lay ahead she did not know.</p>

<p>To keep on telling oneself to bear up seemed of little
use. She had had to do that each hour of each day
since her mother’s death. The prospect of being cast
upon the world was indeed dispiriting, yet in the end
it might turn out better than to sacrifice one’s youth
upon the altar of such a Moloch as Uncle Si.</p>

<p>As people who sleep ill are apt to do, she fell into
a comfortable doze just about the time she ought to
be getting up. Thus, to her dismay, she entered upon
the trying institution known as Monday morning at a
quarter past seven instead of half past six.</p>

<p>“Uncle Si will be growling for his breakfast in another
quarter of an hour,” was the thought that urged
her into her clothes with a frantic haste. One twist
she gave and no more, without so much as a glance in
the glass, at the mane of brown gold hair, and then she
flew downstairs, buttoning the front of her dress.</p>

<p>A fire was burning in the kitchen grate, and upon it
slices of bacon were sizzling in a frying-pan; the cloth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
was laid for breakfast; moreover, the parlour was already
swept and dusted. In fact, at the precise moment
of June’s belated appearance upon the scene, William,
with a businesslike air, was returning from a visit to
the dustbin.</p>

<p>When they met in the passage by the scullery she
came within an ace of rebuking him. “Even if I oversleep
myself you’ve no right to be so officious,” was
the sharp phrase which rose to her lips. But a saving
sense of justice, not always at the service of the female
soul, held it back. After all, such kindness and devotion
were worthy of respect; he had saved, besides, an
unpleasant scene with Uncle Si.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, William, ever so much,” she had
the grace to murmur, hoping as she hastily disposed of
the last button of her dress, that he wouldn’t notice
she had come down, “half undone.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t mention it, Miss June,” he said, with
the politeness of a courtier, as he returned the empty
dustpan to its home beneath the scullery sink. “As you
didn’t seem quite yourself last night I was hoping you
would not get up at all this morning. I was going to
bring your breakfast up to you, and set it outside your
door.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you are much too kind.” A sudden fierce
rush of colour made her cheeks burn horribly. He was
a very nice fellow, even if he was not so bright in some
things as he ought to be.</p>

<p>Uncle Si, by the grace of providence, was a few
minutes late for his breakfast. This seldom happened
for, as a rule, he was the soul of punctuality. However,
he was going down to Newbury by the nine
o’clock from Paddington to attend a sale; in consequence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
he had bestowed far more pains upon his appearance
than was usual at this early hour. He was
in a fairly good humour. The fact that the charwoman’s
return would enable him “to fire” his niece
had cheered him so much that for once he had slept
like a just man.</p>

<p>“Don’t expect me until supper time,” he said to June,
as he put on his high felt hat and his macintosh, and
grasped the knobbed stick, as ugly as himself, which
invariably accompanied his travels. “And my advice
to you, my girl, is to think over very carefully what
I said to you last night.”</p>

<p>With an air of quiet satisfaction, S. Gedge Antiques
stepped briskly forth into a soft autumn day where the
sun as yet could not quite make up its mind to greet
him.</p>

<p>It was to be a day of great events. And the first
of these began to materialise shortly before eleven
when June chanced to enter the shop. William, just
at that moment, was fathoms deep in conversation
with a customer. The customer was very tall, she was
strikingly distinguished and, in the opinion of June,
she was dressed exquisitely. Soft silk and faint blue
Chinese embroidery clothed her with a dangerous
beauty. But it was the coquetry of her hat, an artful
straw wreathed wonderfully in flowers of many a
subtle shade that gave the crowning touch.</p>

<p>The hat it was, no doubt, that completed William’s
overthrow. There was a look of rapture in the eyes
with which the vain fellow regarded its wearer, for
which June could have found it in her heart to slay him
on the spot.</p>

<p>That tell-tale look was really a little too much. June<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
could not help lingering on the threshold to watch these
two. So shamelessly was William engrossed with
this vision of pure beauty that there was not a chance
of his eyes straying to look at her. And she would not
have cared if they had. Such an irrational surge of
jealousy was now in her heart that she would have
welcomed his seeing what she thought of his gazing
like that, even upon the grandest young woman in the
land.</p>

<p>“So nice of you to take so much trouble,” the fair
customer said in a voice of such melody that June had
to own that the celebrated Miss Banks, the daughter
of Blackhampton’s chief physician, whose charm of
manner had ever remained in her mind as the high-water
mark of human amenity, would now have to take
second place.</p>

<p>“Not at all, madam,” said William, in the William
way. Even June had to admit that such fine courtesy,
a little excessive, no doubt, was far removed from mere
sycophancy. Had he not practised on her? For that
reason she had a perfect right to feel furious; William’s
homage was far too inclusive. At the same time,
there was no gainsaying that in this case he had every
excuse. Regarded as the mirror of fashion and the
mould of form, Miss Banks of Blackhampton was
now a back number.</p>

<p>“The friend I sent it to liked it very much indeed,”
said the Super-girl. “It was so exactly what she wanted.
And if by chance you are able to match it, I shall
be most grateful.”</p>

<p>William, with that divine air of his, promised quite
simply and sincerely to do his best.</p>

<p>“The price, too, was very moderate,” said the Super-girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
with the geniality of one who owns a province.
Then suddenly she half turned, and her merry glance,
assisted by a Miss Banksian stick-eyeglass was trained
full upon the Hoodoo. “What a delicious monster!”
The voice had quite a Brahms trill in it, not that June
had ever heard of Brahms. “It reminds one of Edgar
Allan Poe or the Grand Guignol.”</p>

<p>Unabashed by culture, William stood to his full
height. June could only marvel at his coolness.</p>

<p>“So Oriental. So grotesque. Makes one think of
Ali Baba and the Cave of the Forty Robbers. Very
valuable, of course?”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t exactly call it valuable.” June
hardly knew whether to admire or to deplore this candour.
“And it takes up a lot of room, and absorbs
a lot of light. Almost needs the British Museum, as
you might say, to show it to advantage.”</p>

<p>Again the Brahms trill, as the eye of the Super-girl
travelled from the Hoodoo to William. “Those fearful
eyes and those grinning jaws studded with crocodile’s
teeth make it look absolutely alive. And it’s so
perfectly hideous that one feels sure there must be a
curse on it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gedge declares there is.”</p>

<p>“Really?” The eyes, the blue eyes of the Super-girl
grew round and merry. “I’d love to have a thing
with a curse on it&mdash;if it’s a real one?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gedge would part with it for a very reasonable
sum I feel sure,” said William, with a judicious air that
June admired the more for being hardly able to credit
it in him.</p>

<p>With the casual air so becoming to riches, the young
woman asked the price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Twenty pounds would buy it,” she was informed.</p>

<p>“Curse and all?”</p>

<p>“Curse and all, madam.” William had a nice sense
of humour, which June had discovered before she had
known him an hour, but in this big moment he did not
relax a muscle.</p>

<p>For about a quarter of a minute the Super-girl
looked again at the Hoodoo. And then with the air
of one who takes a great decision, she gave the ugly
chin a playful tap and said: “I believe the long gallery
at Homefield is the very place for you, my friend. You
may not be a thing of beauty, but at the far end I am
sure you would be a joy for ever!” She made then
such fine play with her stick-eyeglass, that Miss Banks
was put off the map altogether. “And a real live curse
given in, I think you said?”</p>

<p>William bowed a grave affirmative.</p>

<p>It was clear that Miss Blue Blood was intrigued.
She folded, unfolded, refolded her stick-eyeglass; she
looked the Hoodoo up, she looked the Hoodoo down,
standing three paces back in order to do so. “Before I
really decide”&mdash;addressing the monster in a voice of
warm caresses&mdash;“I must get my father to come and
look at you, my dear. He’s wiser than I in these matters.
You might kill all the pictures in the long gallery.”</p>

<p>At this point William bowed again with exceeding
deference. But here was not the end. The stick-eyeglass
lit on the bowl of Lowestoft, which the Sawney
who was turning out to be not quite such a sawney as
he seemed, had picked up in his recent travels in
Suffolk.</p>

<p>“I like that. What a charming piece!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Half-Sawney held the charming piece to the
light for Miss Stick-eyeglass to gaze upon.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;really quite charming!”</p>

<p>Their heads were so close while together they bent
over its beauties, that June, without wishing real harm
to either, could have found it in her heart to hope that
the bowl might fall from the hands of William and
break into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>“What is the price?”</p>

<p>The bowl was turned on to its base while the young
man glanced at the mystic code which had been traced
by the hand of S. Gedge Antiques.</p>

<p>“Six guineas, madam,” she was most deferentially
informed.</p>

<p>“I collect Lowestoft. A charming piece. It will go
so well with my others. Will you kindly send it to 39b,
Park Lane?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Miss Babraham.”</p>

<p>The amazing Miss Babraham opened a vanity bag,
took out a sheaf of notes, and chose six which, with the
smile of a siren, she handed to William, who received
them with one more bow from his full height, and proceeded
to write out a receipt.</p>

<p>Somehow this transaction was altogether too much
for June. Flashing one long last glance of immeasurable
venom upon the stick-eyeglass who, all unconscious
of the deadly passions it had aroused, had now
returned to elegant and final contemplation of the Hoodoo,
the niece of S. Gedge Antiques withdrew hurriedly
to the scullery sink, filled a bucket of water, and
proceeded with a kind of contained fury to scrub the
floor of the larder.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> William came in to dinner there was
music to face. But as there was no sure ground
at the moment for real battle, the music opened <i>pianissimo</i>.
It began with a few rather pointed enquiries.</p>

<p>“Had a rather busy morning, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it has been anything out of the way,”
was the non-committal answer.</p>

<p>“Done any business?” The question was casual, but
June fixed him with her eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” So light and airy was the tone that business
might have mattered nothing. “I’ve sold the
Lowestoft bowl.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Si’ll be pleased, I expect.” She found it terribly
difficult to keep a sneer out of her voice, but you
never know what you can do till you try. “Fetch
much?”</p>

<p>She knew perfectly well, of course, the price it had
fetched.</p>

<p>“Six guineas!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a pretty good profit on what you paid for
it at Saxmundham?” said June, with the precision of
the born head for affairs.</p>

<p>“I got it for thirty shillings at Saxmundham, but
of course that was at a sale.”</p>

<p>“Seems a fair profit, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is.”</p>

<p>“Will you get any?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Oh no!” said William, trying to spear a pickled
walnut in a glass jar.</p>

<p>“Then I think it’s an infamous shame that the whole
of that six guineas should go into the pocket of Uncle
Si.”</p>

<p>With a polite shake of the head, William dissented.
“But don’t you see, I couldn’t have bought it unless the
master had given me the money, and also marked the
catalogue.”</p>

<p>“It was your brains that bought it. And your brains
sold it, too. I think you ought to see that Uncle Si is
simply living upon them.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Miss June,” said William staunchly.
“Please don’t forget that it is the master who taught
me everything.”</p>

<p>June declined to argue the point. She knew it was
no use. For the hundredth time she was up against
his fixed idea. Besides, there was something else to
talk about.</p>

<p>“To whom did you sell that beautiful bowl?” Her
voice was that of the dove.</p>

<p>“I sold it to a Miss Babraham,” said the Sawney in
a voice of perfectly stupendous impersonality.</p>

<p>“To a Miss Who?”</p>

<p>She had caught the name quite clearly, and not for
the first time that day, but there was a kind of morbid
fascination in toying with a subject which was really
without significance, and could lead nowhere. All the
same she pined for an insight into the workings of the
mind of this strange young man who was such a baffling
mixture of the over-simple and the highly gifted.</p>

<p>“Her name is Miss Babraham.”</p>

<p>“Who is she when she is at home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>She tried hard to imitate a detachment which was a
little uncanny, yet knowing all the time that she was
making a sad hash of the performance. The trick seldom
comes easy to the daughters of Eve.</p>

<p>“Who did you say she was?”</p>

<p>“Her father is Sir Arthur Babraham.” The impersonality
of William made her writhe.</p>

<p>“Oho!” said June, still trying her best to rise to
William’s level, and fully conscious that she was failing
miserably. “One of the big bugs, eh?”</p>

<p>It was vulgar, she knew, to speak in that way.
Among the things she had learned at the Blackhampton
High School was a due and proper regard for baronets.
Miss Preece, its august headmistress, would
have been shocked, not merely by her tone, but also
by her choice of words. But High School or no High
School, the intrusion of Sir Arthur Babraham suddenly
made her see red. She must be vulgar&mdash;or burst!</p>

<p>“What you’d call one of the smart set, I suppose?”
said June abruptly breaking a long and rather trying
pause. “Well, I don’t think much of her stick-eyeglass,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Terrific disparagement of Miss Babraham, her
works and her belongings was intended, yet to the
queer creature seated opposite who by now was almost
ready for the tapioca pudding, which had been so carefully
prepared for him, it did not seem to imply anything
at all.</p>

<p>“You take no stock of smart sets, I dare say,” said
June, with growing truculence. “You’ve never heard
of them, have you? China tea sets are more in your
line, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>That was real wit, and people far less clever than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
this Sawney&mdash;a contradiction in terms and yet the only
word which seemed to describe him after all!&mdash;must
have seen the force of it. But not he! He solemnly
rose and collected the plates, and then fetched in the
tapioca pudding for all the world as if there was absolutely
no point in the remark.</p>

<p>“Who did you say that tall girl was?” said June,
returning mothlike to the flame, as she helped the
Sawney very substantially to his favourite dish.</p>

<p>“Miss Babraham!”</p>

<p>“And who did you say her father was?”</p>

<p>“Sir Arthur Babraham!”</p>

<p>“And what might <i>he</i> do for a living?”</p>

<p>This was not ignorance. It was mere facetiousness.
She knew quite well that no Sir Arthur Babraham
since first invented by that ridiculous monarch, King
James, had ever done anything for a living. But it
was good to feel how such a “break” would have hurt
Miss Preece.</p>

<p>“He’s one of the richest men in England,” said
William, dipping his spoon into his tapioca with an impersonality
which approached the sublime.</p>

<p>June knew that. There was the daughter of Sir
Arthur Babraham to prove it.</p>

<p>“One of Uncle Si’s best customers, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t often come here. But he has wonderful
taste.”</p>

<p>“In daughters?” said June sardonically.</p>

<p>“In everything. Only last night I read in the paper
that there isn’t a better judge of pictures living.”</p>

<p>June merely said “Oh!”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the trustees of the National Gallery,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” said June.</p>

<p>“And owns a very fine private collection of the
Dutch School.”</p>

<p>“Does he?” It was June’s turn now to be impersonal;
in fact, it was up to her to let him see that it
would take more than Sir Arthur Babraham and a private
collection of the Dutch School to impress her.</p>

<p>“I suppose his daughter is what you’d call rather
<i>fetching</i>?” She had once heard the word on the lips
of the admired Miss Banks at a charity bazaar.</p>

<p>But in William’s opinion it was not adequate to the
occasion.</p>

<p>“To my mind,” he said, and his voice fell, “she’s a
non-such.”</p>

<p>June stepped midway in the act of bestowing upon
him a second helping of tapioca.</p>

<p>“She’s a what?” she demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>“A museum piece, Miss June.” His enthusiasm was
restrained but none the less absurd. “She’s hallmarked.
She walks in beauty.” A blush, faint yet
becoming, slowly overspread William’s delicately tinted
complexion.</p>

<p>June snorted. Had it been within the province of
eyes to slay, this Gaby would have had no use for a
second helping of tapioca.</p>

<p>“Glad to know that!” said June, homicidally. “As
you are so set on beauty, you must have had an interesting
morning.”</p>

<p>A disgracefully impersonal silence was William’s
only answer. The deadliness of the observation seemed
completely lost upon him. But was it?&mdash;that was the
question for gods and Woman. Such a silence might
mean anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose you’d say she had wonderful taste?”</p>

<p>“Miss Babraham?”</p>

<p>“No, Joan of Arc,” said Woman, venomously.</p>

<p>“Her taste is very good indeed&mdash;that is, in some
things.”</p>

<p>“In hats, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I meant in old china,” said the impersonal one.
“I’ve never known her to make a mistake in old china.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting.” It was a weak remark, but
June had seldom felt less conversationally brilliant.</p>

<p>Silence again. A third helping of tapioca was
politely declined. June then pushed across the cheese.
William removed its cover, and disclosed an extremely
meagre piece of Leicestershire.</p>

<p>“Please may I give you a little?” he asked, with his
inimitable air.</p>

<p>“There’ll be none for yourself if you do. Besides,
I don’t want any. No thank you.” She remembered
her manners, although that was not easy just now.
“I’ll go out presently and buy some more. I’d quite
forgotten the cheese.”</p>

<p>“Please&mdash;please take this tiny piece.”</p>

<p>“When I say no, I don’t mean yes,” said June, tempering
strength of character with calm politeness. “I
can’t imagine Miss Babraham eating a piece of Leicestershire
cheese in a dirty overall&mdash;can you?”</p>

<p>The remark was so irrelevant that it verged upon
the grotesque. Heaven knows from what malign impulse
it sprang. No girl in her senses would ever have
made it. Giant Despair and the Hag Desperation must
have been its sponsors.</p>

<p>It was quite open to William to follow the line of
least resistance and ignore the question. A William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
less true-blue, a William less a gentleman right
through to the core might without dishonour have done
so. But this was a William of a nobler clay.</p>

<p>“Miss June, your overall isn’t dirty.”</p>

<p>The rich sincerity of these six and a half little words
seemed gravely to imperil the whole sublime edifice
of his impersonality.</p>

<p>He was contradicted flatly for his pains; yet she
knew in her heart that whether the overall was dirty
or whether it was clean, the renegade was already half
forgiven.</p>

<p>“What did you think of her dress?” This new on-rush
of irrelevance was despicable, but she seemed
quite to have lost control of herself.</p>

<p>“It was perfect. To my mind, nothing is more becoming
to a tall lady than a dress of soft dark blue
silk.”</p>

<p>Dyed-in-the-wool idiot! As though it was not his
clear and obvious duty never even to have noticed
whether Miss Babraham wore a dress of soft blue silk
or a muslin with spots or a grey alpaca, or just a plain
serge coat and skirt. Times there are when the stupidity
of the human male has really no limit.</p>

<p>“Must have cost a pretty penny,” said June acidly.</p>

<p>William shook his head, and boldly affirmed that it
couldn’t be bought for money.</p>

<p>“That’s just nonsense,” said June tartly. “There
isn’t a dress in the world that couldn’t be bought for
money.”</p>

<p>“What I really mean is, to have a dress which looked
like that, you would also have to buy the wearer,” said
William the amazing.</p>

<p>June expressed a ripe scorn by vehemently beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
to clear the table. High time, certainly. They
had been discussing cold mutton and pickled walnuts
and tapioca pudding and Leicestershire cheese and
things and women for one solid hour by the Queen
Anne clock, a real antique, in the middle of the chimneypiece,
for which S. Gedge had lately refused the
sum of forty guineas.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the course of the afternoon, June found herself
immersed in the crisis of her fate. It began with
a desire to own a dress of soft blue silk. This, she well
knew, was insane. In the first place, she was still in
mourning for her mother; in the second, she must
hoard every penny of her slender means; in the third,
was William’s conviction that the success of a dress
depended upon its wearer.</p>

<p>Not a shade of excuse could be found for this vaulting
ambition. But it was fixed so firmly in the centre
of her mind, that when she set out soon after three to
order the cheese she could think of nothing else. The
grocer was at the end of the street and two minutes
did her business with him. And then in the toils of
imperious desire she marched boldly down to Charing
Cross and took a bus to Oxford Circus.</p>

<p>A yearning for a dress of blue silk was upon her like
a passion. It was madness and yet it was very delicious.
What could a blue silk dress avail when at any
moment she was likely to be cast adrift? That thought
hit hard as she sauntered slowly along the Street of
Streets gazing wistfully upon its long array of too-fascinating
drapers’ windows.</p>

<p>Her store of worldly wealth was nineteen pounds
and a few odd shillings. It was as certain as anything
could be that she was about to enter upon the most
critical period of her life, and this was all she had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
tide her over. But do what she would to act like a reasonable
being she was now at the mercy of a demon
more powerful than common prudence. She was
haunted by a passion for a blue silk dress and no matter
what happened to her afterwards she must satisfy
that craving.</p>

<p>It was a rather thrilling business to rake these forbidden
windows in quest of a thing it was sheer madness
to buy, yet within one’s power to do so. Why was
she going to buy it? Because she wanted it so badly?
Why did she want it so badly? That was a question
she could not answer.</p>

<p>Had she been really pretty this folly might have
seemed less amazing. But she knew she was plain.
At least, she always felt and always passed for plain
at Blackhampton. But her pilgrimage along Oxford
Street which, in the middle of a bright afternoon of
early October, seemed the Mecca of fashion, beauty
and good taste went some way to change the attitude
she had taken up in regard to her personal appearance.</p>

<p>Plain she might be, her clothes might be severely
provincial, their hue depressing, but she was clearly
informed by the sixth sense given to Woman that she
was not wholly unlooked at. It was nice to feel that
such was the case; indeed, it was stimulating, yet so
deeply was she occupied just then with large affairs
that she didn’t think much about it.</p>

<p>After many windows she had seen, she found herself
drifting with the tide into a store of regal aspect.
Here she was received by young women, elegant and
gracious, with a courteous charm that made a search
for five yards of blue silk fabric in its least expensive
form a perfectly simple and yet delightful adventure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Moreover, it brought in its train a great idea. Was it
necessary, after all, that domestic servitude should be
her lot? Might it not be possible to become one of
these smart and pleasant ladies in their very attractive
clothes?</p>

<p>Expenditure of spirit, anxious care, went to the final
purchase of four and a half yards of cotton silk material,
more cotton than silk, at eight and elevenpence
three farthings a yard; and then the new thought
gained such a hold upon her, that before leaving the
store she took an inventory of her person in one of the
huge mirrors which made the place so enchanting.
Standing boldly in front of the great glass, surveying
herself with a curiosity that was half fear, she went
over her “points” as might an Eastern merchant who
buys a slave.</p>

<p>She was taller than she supposed. That was
thought the first. And if she wore shoes with high
heels, as so many girls did, she could look still taller.
She could pass for slender, that was her second
thought; and her chest was something to be proud of.
She might not have much in the way of grace, and she
might lack style, yet she didn’t lack dignity. Her features
were irregular, and there was no denying their
freckles, but seeing her frontispiece this afternoon,
with its fighting chin and determined eyes, the full
effect was rather striking. But when all was said it
was her hair that was important. This she had always
known, but in the strong and subtle lights of the best
mirror into which she had ever gazed, it ministered
considerably to the sum and total of her charms. Perhaps
her friend, Mr. Boultby the druggist, had not
overshot the mark when he compared her hair to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Empress Eugenie’s, and said it ought to be painted by
an R. A.</p>

<p>A mop of russet gold hair was little enough for a
girl who stood in her particular shoes. She felt that as
she gazed upon it; felt it besides with something akin
to resentment. But even a self-criticism, cool and stern,
must allow that she made a better showing in Mr. Selfridge’s
mirror than could have been expected. She
was far from being beautiful, but that hair in its subtle-tinted
abundance saved her somehow from being ordinary.
And to-day she looked very much alive with the
bloom of youth and health.</p>

<p>Four and a half yards of blue material under her
arm, she went out into Oxford Street, feeling rather
better equipped for the battle of life. She drew back
a pair of shoulders that were really not so bad, and
defiantly lifted a chin that had looked uncommonly
square in the mirror. It was good to feel that she had
underrated herself. She must learn to dress in the
London way, and then she might be able to hold her
own.</p>

<p>Walking slowly back to Oxford Circus, head higher
now, she began quite to like this new idea of becoming
a shop assistant. At the worst, it would be a far easier
and more dignified way of life than domestic service.
So much was she engaged by it, and so great the pressure
of her thoughts that at first she didn’t notice that
a man was following her.</p>

<p>The knowledge overtook her by degrees. Stopping
to look in various windows, each time she did so
brought a vague feeling that the eyes of a man were
upon her. She crossed the Circus, but the feeling was
still there; and at the corner of Berners Street, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
quite knowing how, surmise entered the region of
fact. Moreover, she even contrived to learn the style
of man he was.</p>

<p>Out of the tail of an eye, as she stood by the edge
of the kerb, she saw that he was pale and dark, neither
short nor tall, that he had a slight moustache, and wore
a hat of peach coloured velours. His presence gave
her an odd feeling; in fact, it might be said to frighten
her just a little, although there was certainly no reason
why it should in broad daylight. But she had an idea
that he was going to speak to her and that he was seeking
an opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>Hastily she moved on, determined to give further
shop windows “a miss” for the present. However, she
had not gone far when it occurred to her that she was
in need of a cup of tea, and that it would be very pleasant
to have one.</p>

<p>Just across the road was an A. B. C. shop. The fear
of pursuit still upon her, the sudden dash she made for
this bourn was so ill-timed that her sovereign faculty
of keeping her head in a crisis was needed to save her
from being run over by Bus 13, which was going to the
“Bell” at Hendon.</p>

<p>With quite a sense of adventure, she went to one of
a row of vacant tables at the far end of the shop. She
ordered a small pot of tea, a scone and a pat of butter.
And then she realized that a pale, dark man, neither
short nor tall, with a slight moustache, and wearing a
hat of peach-coloured velours had followed her in, and
was just about to take a seat at the table next her own.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> was not a timid girl. She had no lack of courage;
and now that a chance had been given her to
reason things out, a feeling akin to fear promptly
yielded to mere annoyance. And even that emotion
took wings when she had had time to glance at the hat
of peach-coloured velours. Its owner looked harmless
enough. He was a man of thirty, or perhaps a little
more; he wore a well-cut black jacket, a pair of rather
baggy trousers of a light grey check, a silk collar, a
flowing bow tie, a diamond ring on the little finger of
the left hand. The general effect of what to June was
a decidedly interesting personality was somehow to
fulfil her preconceived idea of an artist.</p>

<p>As soon as the man felt the gaze of June upon him,
he swept off the hat of peach-coloured velours with a
gesture at once easy and graceful, fortified it with a
smile at which it would have been impossible to take
offence, and said with a slight lisp,</p>

<p>“Miss Graham?”</p>

<p>“I am not Miss Graham,” said June calmly. She
always prided herself upon her self-possession. Just
now it seemed to help her considerably.</p>

<p>The man carried off his question with such an air
of tact that it must have ranked as a bona fide mistake
had not June been aware that he had crossed the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
and followed her into the shop. Rather strangely, as
soon as he took it upon himself to speak to her, the
lingering sense of vexation gave way to curiosity. The
mere look of the man had the power to excite an immediate
interest, but June was careful to keep strictly
upon her guard.</p>

<p>He ordered a bottle of ginger beer, and when the
waitress had gone for it, he turned to June and said,
with the companionable air of an old friend: “It’s
funny, but you are exactly like a girl I used to know.”</p>

<p>“Why funny?” asked June bluntly.</p>

<p>The nature of the question, and the look of June’s
keen eye made the man smile a little. Evidently she
was a bit of a character. It appeared to stimulate him.</p>

<p>“It’s always funny when you mistake someone for
someone else.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” said June, warily.</p>

<p>“Don’t you agree,” he said, with a laugh that sounded
decidedly pleasant.</p>

<p>“It’s a thing I should never think of doing myself.”</p>

<p>“You are lucky.” He was amused by her bluntness.
“I wish I had your good memory.”</p>

<p>The tea arrived, and June poured it out in a spirit
of thankfulness. As soon as she had drunk half a cup,
which was reviving, she forgot all about her annoyance
in a new feeling of exhilaration tempered by
quiet amusement.</p>

<p>“You are most remarkably like a Scotch girl I used
to know in Paris,” said the man, taking up the thread
of conversation, after having drunk a little, a very little,
ginger beer.</p>

<p>“Am I?” said June, coolly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“She was an artist’s model. Sometimes she used to
sit for me.”</p>

<p>“Are you an artist?” said June, allowing herself
to become interested, for the reason perhaps that she
simply could not help it.</p>

<p>“Of sorts,” was the answer. “I studied several
years in Paris before the war.”</p>

<p>From the moment he had sat down at the next table
and June had been able to get a clear view of him she
had somehow known that art was his calling. He
looked an artist so emphatically that there would have
been something fatally wrong with the cosmos had he
turned out to be anything else.</p>

<p>In spite of a determination to be cautious indeed,
she was not equal to the task of repressing an ever
growing curiosity. Art had lately come to have a
magic meaning for her.</p>

<p>“What kind of pictures do you paint?”</p>

<p>“Portraits and the figure chiefly.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever paint landscapes?”</p>

<p>“They are not quite my line of country,” said the
man. “Portraits and the figure are what I go for as a
rule. I am looking for a model now. Would you like
to sit to me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” June spoke doubtfully. “I don’t
think I could.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever sat?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Time you began. You are just the sort of girl.”</p>

<p>“Why am I?”</p>

<p>“For one thing you have personality.”</p>

<p>This was a surprising and rather thrilling corroboration
of Mr. Boultby. At the back of her mind the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
druggist had always figured as “a bit of a gasbag” with
a ready flow of conversation and a gift of easy compliment.
But it would seem that this estimate did him
less than justice. Mr. Boultby was better informed
than she had thought. And at this moment a phrase
he had used came back to her with a force that was a
little startling. “A girl as good-looking as you can
always get a living,” Mr. Boultby had once said.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean my hair?” said June naïvely.</p>

<p>He showed two rows of very white and level teeth
in a smile which piqued her curiosity.</p>

<p>“Partly your hair, and partly your figure,” he said,
taking a second tiny sip of ginger beer. “Why not
come and try? I have a studio in Haliburton Street,
just out of Manning Square.”</p>

<p>June shook a doubtful head. She then gave a glance
sideways at the imbiber of the ginger beer. Her
knowledge of the world was slender, but she was not
a fool, and there was something about this “forthcomingness”
which even exceeded that of Mr. Boultby himself,
that warned her to be careful.</p>

<p>“You’d be well paid, of course.”</p>

<p>“How much?” June had no false modesty when it
came to a question of money. This was an aspect of
the matter that had not struck her until then.</p>

<p>“I’d pay you five shillings an hour,” he said lightly.
“And ten for the altogether.”</p>

<p>June’s heart gave a leap. To a girl in her position
it was a princely reward. Such an offer seemed most
tempting. But a moment’s consideration of the issues
it raised brought on a sudden fit of shyness.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I could,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?” The eyes of the man were now fixed
intently upon her face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not enough, eh?”</p>

<p>She felt his eyes so forcibly upon her that she coloured
hotly.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that.”</p>

<p>“What’s your reason then?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not been used to that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>He smiled broadly.</p>

<p>“It’s only a matter of keeping still. Of course, I
shall not press you to sit for ‘the altogether’ if you
had rather not.”</p>

<p>“The altogether” was Greek to June.</p>

<p>However, she did not confess her ignorance, but was
content to make a mental note to ask William what it
meant. And at the moment she did so the thought of
William brought the Van Roon to her mind.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know a lot about pictures?” An
idea was forming already in that practical head.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I know as much about them as some people,”
said the man, beginning to roll a cigarette. June
could not help feeling that his answer was in piquant
contrast to what William’s would have been had such
a question been put to him. It had a self-complacency
which even if it implied deep knowledge was also open
to criticism.</p>

<p>“What do you think a Van Roon would be worth?”</p>

<p>“A Van Roon!” he said, offhandedly. “Well, you
know, that might depend on many things.”</p>

<p>“They are very valuable, I suppose,” said June, trying
to look innocent.</p>

<p>“Very valuable indeed, at the present time. Privately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
I think they are overrated. The Flemish School
is being run to death, but of course, that’s only my
opinion.”</p>

<p>“Would it be worth a hundred pounds?”</p>

<p>“What! A Van Roon!” The man laughed. “My
good girl, you might multiply a hundred pounds by a
hundred, and then think you had got ‘some’ bargain
if you found yourself the owner of a Van Roon.”</p>

<p>“This mightn’t be a good one.” June spoke cautiously.
She saw at once that it would be wise “to go
slow.”</p>

<p>“All Van Roons are good, you know. But some, of
course, are a bit better than others.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been told it is one of the best,” said June, after
a moment’s deliberation.</p>

<p>“Which are you talking about? The one in the National
Gallery, I suppose. That’s the only Van Roon
in this country. The Americans have robbed us of
three within the last ten years.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard so,” said June, with a wise air.</p>

<p>“In my humble opinion, it can’t be compared with
the chap in the Louvre, and they say that its stable
companion, which was cut out of its frame back in the
Nineties, and has never been found, is even finer.”</p>

<p>“Still you think it’s very valuable?”</p>

<p>“The one in the National Gallery? Sure! It
wouldn’t be there, you know, if it wasn’t. The Flemish
School is booming these days, and Van Roon is the
pick of the bunch, and the least prolific. Tell me,”
the man’s small and rather furtive eyes began to twinkle,
“why are you so interested in Van Roons? Is
it, by any chance, that you’ve got one for sale?” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
he laughed very softly and gently at what he evidently
considered a rich joke.</p>

<p>June looked at him gravely.</p>

<p>“It so happens that I have!” she said with a caution
which seemed to give the value of drama to a simple
announcement.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>dolph Keller</span> was the man’s name. And
as June was to learn later, he had never felt
more amused in his life. It was really a jest that he
should follow a countrified-looking girl into a teashop,
get into conversation with her, and then be quietly told
that she had a Van Roon to sell. There was something
rather pathetic in a girl of her class making such a
statement. All she could mean was that somehow she
had got hold of a more or less “dud” copy of “Sun
and Cloud,” that much lithographed work in the National
Gallery which in consequence was now familiar
to the big public.</p>

<p>“So you’ve got a Van Roon for sale, have you?”
said Adolph Keller, who was hardly able to keep from
laughing outright. “Good for you! What’s the size
of it?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen inches by twelve,” said June, with the patness
of one who prided herself, and with reason, upon
a most excellent memory.</p>

<p>“Without the frame?”</p>

<p>June nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s about the size,” said Keller. “It’s called
‘Sun and Cloud,’ I suppose?”</p>

<p>“It’s not called anything at present,” said June, “as
far as I know, although sun and cloud are in it.”</p>

<p>“Bound to be&mdash;if it’s a Van Roon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“And there are trees as well.”</p>

<p>“Trees, are there? A copy of the one in the National
Gallery, I expect. Is there a windmill in the left hand
corner?”</p>

<p>There was no windmill in the left hand corner, June
declared with confidence. She remembered that at first
William had thought there was, but had changed his
opinion later.</p>

<p>“Then that washes out the National Gallery. I dare
say it’s a copy of ‘L’Automne’ in the Louvre. By the
way, how did you come by it?”</p>

<p>“It was given to me by a gentleman, a friend of
mine,” said June, after a moment for reflection.</p>

<p>“A very good friend, too.” The tone of the laugh
had a little too much banter to be pleasant. “Isn’t
everybody, you know, who gives a Van Roon to his
best girl? A bit of a plutocrat evidently.”</p>

<p>June didn’t know what a plutocrat was, but she was
too proud to say so. She made a mental note to look
up the word in the dictionary.</p>

<p>“How did your rich friend come by it? Do you happen
to know?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t rich,” said June, with a wish for perfect
honesty. “He found it in a shop.”</p>

<p>“Where was the shop?”</p>

<p>“It was at a place called Crowdham Market.”</p>

<p>“Down in Suffolk. Sounds a funny place to find a
Van Roon.”</p>

<p>“It was ever so dirty when it was found. And another
picture seemed to have been painted on the top
of it.”</p>

<p>“Queer.” The eyes of Adolph Keller narrowed in
their intentness. “Who told you it was a Van Roon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“The man who gave it to me.”</p>

<p>“Who told him?”</p>

<p>“He found the signature.” June’s quiet precision
owed something to the fact that she was now fully and
rather deliciously aware of the effect she was making.</p>

<p>“What!... The signature of Mynheer Van
Roon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said June.</p>

<p>The incredulity of Keller had yielded now to a powerful
curiosity. He looked at June with a keenness
he tried hard to veil. This was a very unlikely story,
yet he knew enough of life to appreciate the fact that
mere unlikelihood is no reason why a story should not
be true. Besides, this girl had such an ingenuous air
that it was impossible to believe her tale was a deliberate
invention. At the same time, it had elements which
were particularly hard to swallow.</p>

<p>“Why was the picture given to you?”</p>

<p>“I asked for it,” said June, whose simple honesty
now involved a tell-tale blush.</p>

<p>Mr. Keller looked her steadily in the eye, and then
he laughed, but not unsympathetically.</p>

<p>“Your best boy, I suppose, and he could deny you
nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said June awkwardly. This audacious
irony was new to her, and she did not know how to
meet it.</p>

<p>“By the way, what is this young chap of yours? An
artist?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said June. “I suppose he is&mdash;in a way. He
studies art and renovates pictures, and he knows a lot
about them.”</p>

<p>“Not so much as he thinks,” said Adolph Keller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
“else he would not be such a fool as to give away
a Van Roon, even to a girl as nice and pretty as you
are.”</p>

<p>He had lowered his voice to a whisper of rare
sweetness and carrying power. There was something
about him that was powerfully attractive; at the same
time, a look had crept into a pair of rather furtive eyes
which was oddly repellent.</p>

<p>“Do you say you really have this picture in your
possession?” His intentness when he put this question
made June feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Yes, it has been given to me.”</p>

<p>“Could you let me see it?”</p>

<p>June hesitated.</p>

<p>“I think I could,” she said, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you bring it round to my studio for
me to look at?”</p>

<p>Again June hesitated.</p>

<p>“As you like, of course,” said Keller, carelessly. “I
was only thinking it might be worth your while, that’s
all. You see, I happen to know one or two dealers
and people, and I might be able to find out for you just
what it’s worth.”</p>

<p>June saw the force of this. She was in desperate
straits, and this man had the appearance of a friend
in need.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will,” she said.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the man. “When will you come?”</p>

<p>For a moment June thought hard. “I couldn’t come
before Thursday.”</p>

<p>“The day after to-morrow&mdash;that’ll suit me. What
time?”</p>

<p>June continued to think hard. “It would have to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
between three and four.” She spoke with slow reluctance.
“That’s the only time I can really get away.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the man, briskly. “You’ll find me
at the Haliburton Street Studios up till five o’clock on
Thursday. Number Four. Give a good ring; the bell
is a bit out of gear. My name is Keller. Can you remember
it, or shall I write it down for you, with the
address?”</p>

<p>“Write them down for me, please.”</p>

<p>The man tore a leaf from a pocket book, and wrote
his name and address with a fountain pen: Adolph
Keller, 4 Haliburton Street Studios, Manning Square,
Soho. When he had done this, and given it to her, he
tore out another leaf and asked her to write down hers.
This she accordingly did, and then the sudden thought
of William’s tea caused her to rise abruptly.</p>

<p>Mr. Keller wished to pay her bill, which was five-pence,
but she declined to let him.</p>

<p>“Au revoir! Thursday afternoon. Manning
Square is only about three minutes from here. Don’t
forget,” were the words with which he took leave of
her. “Bring it along. I dare say I’ll be able to tell you
whether it is genuine, and perhaps give you an idea of
its value.”</p>

<p>He laughed slightly, and then offered his hand in a
very friendly manner. She took it with a reluctance
she was rather ashamed of showing. He was so kind,
so agreeable, so anxious to be of use that there seemed
no warrant for the subtle complexity of feeling he had
aroused in her.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une’s</span> way home to New Cross Street was beset
with anxieties. Much would depend on what she
did now. She felt that her whole life was about to turn
on the decision she had to take in a very difficult
matter.</p>

<p>There was no one to guide her, not a soul on whose
advice she might lean. But before she had returned
to the threshold of S. Gedge Antiques she had made a
resolve to get immediate possession of the picture, and
to let this Mr. Keller have a look at it. She did not
altogether like him, it was true. But the feeling was
irrational; she must be sensible enough not to let it set
her against him without due cause. For he was a
friend whom Providence had unmistakably thrown in
her way, and there was no other to whom she might
turn.</p>

<p>William was a broken reed. With all his perception
and talent, he was likely to prove hopeless now that
Uncle Si was setting his wits to work to obtain the
picture for himself. William’s devotion to his master’s
interest would be simply fatal to her scheme. For
the sake of them both, June felt she must take a full
advantage of the heaven-sent opportunity provided by
this Mr. Keller.</p>

<p>Other decisions, too, would have to be made. As
soon as Uncle Si knew the picture was hers, he would
almost certainly carry out his threat of putting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
in the street; at least she was no judge of character
if the event proved otherwise. A means of livelihood
must be sought at once. That afternoon’s experience
of Oxford Street had opened up new vistas, which,
however, might lead nowhere. But even if she could
not get employment in a shop Mr. Keller’s offer of
work as an artist’s model at five shillings an hour must
not be lightly put aside.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done, however, was to clinch
William’s gift of the picture once and for all. She
made up her mind that it should be fully consummated
before the return of Uncle Si from Newbury.</p>

<p>As soon as William had been given his tea she
broached the subject. But when she asked for possession,
there and then, his crest fell.</p>

<p>“I was still hoping, Miss June,” the simpleton
owned, “that you’d let the dear old master have this
lovely thing. It has come to mean so much to him,
you see. I will get another one for you.”</p>

<p>“Not another Van Roon,” said June, sharply.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid I couldn’t promise a Van Roon.”
A cloud passed over William’s face. “But I might be
able to pick up something quite good, which perhaps
you would come to like as much.”</p>

<p>June shook a disconsolate head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” she said, in a slow voice, as she fixed
her eyes on the wall in front of her, “there is another
picture in the world I should value so much as that
one. I simply love that picture.”</p>

<p>William was troubled.</p>

<p>“The old master loves it, too.”</p>

<p>“But you gave it me, you know.” June was painfully
conscious of a swift deepening of colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>The plain fact was not denied.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think me very hard and grasping if I
hold you to the bargain.”</p>

<p>“No, Miss June. If you insist, of course the picture
is yours.”</p>

<p>“To do with just as I like.”</p>

<p>“Why yes, certainly.”</p>

<p>June proceeded to take the bull by the horns. “Very
well,” she said. “After supper, I shall ask you to hand
it over to me, and I will put it in a place of safety.”</p>

<p>William sighed heavily. He seemed almost upon
the verge of tears. June simply loathed the part she
was playing. The only consolation was that she was
acting quite as much in his interest as in her own.</p>

<p>Uncle Si came in shortly before eight. He sat down
to supper in quite a good humour. For once the old
man was in high conversational feather.</p>

<p>It was clear that his mind was still full of the picture.
Without subscribing for one moment to William’s
preposterous theory that the thing was a genuine
Van Roon, he had had a further talk on the matter
with his friend, Mr. Thornton, with whom he had
travelled down to Newbury; and, he had arranged with
that gentleman to bring his friend, Monsieur Duponnet,
the famous Paris expert who was now in London,
to come and look at it on Thursday afternoon. Monsieur
Duponnet who knew more about Van Roon than
anybody living, and had had several pass through his
hands in the last ten years, would be able to say positively
whether William was wrong, and S. Gedge
Antiques was right, or with a devout gesture for which
June longed to pull his ugly nose, vice versâ.</p>

<p>The time had now come for June to show her hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
Very quietly indeed her bolt was launched. William
had given the picture to her.</p>

<p>The old man simply stared at her.</p>

<p>It was clear, however, that his thoughts were running
so hard upon M. Duponnet and the higher potentialities
that just at first he was not able to grasp the
significance of June’s bald statement.</p>

<p>So that there should be no doubt about the position
June modestly repeated it.</p>

<p>“Given it to you!” said the old man, a light beginning
to break. “How do you mean&mdash;given it to you?”</p>

<p>Calmly, patiently June threw a little more light on
the subject. And while she did so her eyes were fixed
with veiled defiance upon the face of Uncle Si. The
thought uppermost in her mind was that he took it far
better than could have been expected. “Given it to
you,” he kept on saying to himself softly. There was
no explosion. “Given it to you,” he kept on. He
grew a little green about the gills and that was all.</p>

<p>At last he turned to William: “Boy, what’s this? Is
the girl daft?” The mildness of tone was astonishing.</p>

<p>William explained as well as he could. It was a
lame and halting performance, and at that moment
June was not proud of him. But she was even less
proud of herself. The part she was playing, gloss it
over as one might, was ignoble. And William’s embarrassment
was rather painful to witness. He stammered
a good deal, he grew red and nervous; and all
the while the voice of his kind and good master became
more deeply reproachful, and melted finally in a
note of real pathos. “How could you do such a
thing?” he said. “Why you know as well as I do, my
boy, that I would have given you anything in reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
for that picture&mdash;anything in reason.” And there he
sat at his supper, the very image of outraged benevolence
and enthusiasm, a Christian with a halo!</p>

<p>“Old Serpent” said the fierce eyes that June fixed
upon his face. For a moment it looked as if the old
wretch was going to shed tears. But no, he was content
with a mild snuffle and that was all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIII">XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y</span> bedtime, when June went to her attic, she had
fully made up her mind that there must be no
half measures now. She feared Uncle Si more than
ever. There was something in that snuffle at the supper
table, in that whine of outraged feeling, in that
down-gazing eye which was far more formidable than
any mere outburst of violence. Here was such a depth
of hypocrisy that she had got to look out.</p>

<p>A light was showing under the studio door. June’s
knock met with a prompt invitation to enter. William
was affectionately lingering over a few final touches,
which should prove beyond a doubt the authenticity of
this masterpiece.</p>

<p>“Have you got it really clean at last?” said June,
trying to speak lightly, yet not succeeding. Emotional
strain could not be so easily concealed; and&mdash;uncomfortable
thought&mdash;her acting was not so finished as that
of Uncle Si.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said William, with a little thrill of rapture.
“And how wonderful it is!”</p>

<p>June agreed. “Yes, wonderful!” Also with a little
thrill of rapture, yet loathing herself because her tone
was so vibrant&mdash;Uncle Si was not to have a walk over
after all! “And now if you don’t mind I’ll put it in a
place of safety.”</p>

<p>He flashed one swift glance at her. “But, Miss
June, isn’t it quite safe here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“I should just think it wasn’t!” leapt to the tip of her
tongue. But Uncle Si’s masterly snuffle recalled to her
mind the value of meiosis. Thus she had recourse to a
gentle “I think I’ll sleep better if I take care of it myself,”
which sounded quite disarming.</p>

<p>With one of his deep sighs which made her feel a
perfect beast, William handed over the picture. “If
you only knew, if you could only guess what pleasure
this exquisite thing would give the dear old
master&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Overcome by a kind of nausea, June fled headlong
to the room next door. She groped for her candle,
found and lit it; and then she proceeded to bury the
treasure at the bottom of her trunk. Heaping and
pressing down as many things upon the picture as
the trunk would hold, she locked it carefully, and put
the key in her purse. Then she undressed, knelt and
said her prayers; she then blew out the candle and
crept into bed with a stifling sense of disgust, tempered
by grim satisfaction.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIV">XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ext</span> morning at the breakfast table, June looked
for developments. To her surprise, however,
things went their accustomed way, except that if anything
Uncle Si was a little more amiable than usual.
He made no reference to the Van Roon; but it was
referred to in his manner, inasmuch that he bore bacon
and coffee to his lips with the air of a known good man
deeply wounded in his private feelings. Not a feather
of this by-play was lost upon his niece; and no doubt
what was of more importance, it was not lost upon
William. But its impact was very different in the two
cases. While June simply longed to hit the Old Crocodile
upon his long and wicked nose, William seemed
hard set to refrain from tears.</p>

<p>About midday, however, while June was in the back
kitchen preparing a meal, Uncle Si came to her.</p>

<p>“Niece,” he said, in the new voice, whose softness
June found so formidable, “you remember the other
day I told you to look for a job?”</p>

<p>June nodded.</p>

<p>“Have you got one?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. R. is coming back on Monday, so the
sooner you get fixed up the better. Your best plan, I
think, is to go this afternoon and have your name put
down at a registry office as a cook-general. Cook-generals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
earn good money, and they live all found.
Your cooking won’t be the Carlton or the Ritz, of
course”&mdash;a gleam of frosty humour played upon that
subtle face&mdash;“but you seem strong and willing, and
you know how to boil a potato, and no doubt you’ll
improve with experience.”</p>

<p>June was inclined to curtsey. The old wretch
plainly felt that he was giving her a handsome testimonial.
But at the back of her mind was anger and
contempt, and it was as much as she could do to prevent
their peeping out.</p>

<p>After dinner, as soon as the table was clear, and the
pots washed, she proceeded to take Uncle Si at his
word. She decided to go out at once and look for a
place which, however, except as a last resort, should
not be domestic service. To begin with, she would try
the shops, or perhaps the dressmakers, as her mother
always said she was handy with her needle; or, failing
these, she might consider the exciting proposal of becoming
an artist’s model.</p>

<p>Fixing her hat before the crazy looking glass the
thought of Mr. Keller recurred to her mind. Had the
day only been Thursday she could have taken the picture
to him there and then, and had his opinion upon
it. Not that such a course would have been altogether
wise. She knew nothing about this new and rather
mysterious acquaintance, beyond the fact that if speech
and manner meant anything he was a gentleman. Certainly,
to talk to he was most agreeable.</p>

<p>Before setting out on her pilgrimage, she had to
make up her mind as to whether it would not be advisable
to take the Van Roon with her, and put it in a
place of safety. So long as it remained under that roof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
it was in jeopardy. Uncle Si was not to be trusted an
inch. The fact, however, that she had nowhere to take
the treasure decided her finally to let it stay where it
was until the next day.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was under lock and key. That was something
to be thankful for; yet as she came downstairs
and passed through the shop into New Cross Street,
drawing on her neat black gloves with a sinking heart,
instinct told her that she was taking a grave risk in
leaving the picture behind.</p>

<p>No, S. Gedge Antiques was not to be trusted for a
moment. Of that she was quite sure. By the time
she had gone twenty yards along the street this feeling
of insecurity took such a hold upon her that she stopped
abruptly, and faced about. To go back? Or not to go
back? Indecision was unlike her, but never was it so
hard to make up her mind. Could it be that Uncle Si
was as wicked as she thought? Perhaps she had now
become the prey of her own guilty conscience. In any
case, she knew of nowhere just then in which to place
the precious thing; and this fact it was that turned the
scale and finally settled the question.</p>

<p>She went down to the Strand, and took a bus to
Oxford Circus. That Mecca, alas, did not prove nearly
so stimulating as the previous afternoon. As soon as
she came really to grips with that most daunting of all
tasks, “the looking for a job,” her hopes and her courage
were woefully dashed. Real pluck was needed to
enter such a palace as David Jones Limited, to go up
without faltering to some haughty overseer in a frock
coat and spats and ask if an assistant was wanted.</p>

<p>Three times, in various shops, she screwed herself
to the heroic pitch of asking that difficult question.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Three times she met with a chilling response. And
the only gleam of hope was on the last occasion.</p>

<p>“There is one vacancy, I believe,” said Olympian
Zeus. “But all applicants must apply by letter for a
personal interview with the manager.”</p>

<p>Sooner than renew the attempt just then, June felt
she would prefer to die. A girl from the provinces,
new to London and its ways, without credentials or
friends, or knowledge of “the ropes” must not expect
to be taken on, at any rate in Oxford Street.</p>

<p>Much cast down she returned to her teashop of yesterday.
Seated at the same table, her mind went back
to the fascinating acquaintance she had made there.
Was it possible that a career had been offered her?
Or was the suggestion of this new friend merely the
outcome of a keen interest in the picture?</p>

<p>It could not be so entirely, because she clearly remembered
that Mr. Keller had proposed her sitting to
him as a model before she had mentioned the picture
at all.</p>

<p>She went back to New Cross Street in a state of
gloom; her mind was dominated by a sense of being
“up against it.” And this unhappy feeling was not
softened by the discovery she made as soon as she entered
that cold and uninviting garret. In her absence
the lock of her trunk had been forced and the picture
taken away.</p>

<p>The tragedy was exactly what she had foreseen.
But faced by the bitter fact she was swept by a tempest
of rage. It could only be the work of one person. Her
fear and dislike of Uncle Si rose to hatred now.</p>

<p>In a surge of anger she went downstairs and in the
presence of William charged Uncle Si.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve been at my box,” she stormed.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a kind of calm pensiveness
over the top of his spectacles.</p>

<p>“If you lock away things, my girl, that don’t belong
to you, I’m afraid you’ll have to stand the racket.” So
lofty, so severe was the old man’s tone that for the
moment June was staggered.</p>

<p>“It’s stealing,” she cried, returning hectic to the
attack.</p>

<p>Uncle Si waggled a magisterial finger in her face.
“Niece,” he said, with a quietude which put her at a
disadvantage, “I must ask you not to make an exhibition
of yourself. Have the goodness to hold your
tongue.”</p>

<p>June maintained the charge. “The picture’s mine.
William gave it me. You’ve broken open my box and
stolen it.”</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques, after a mild side glance in the
direction of William, proceeded to fix a glacial eye
upon his niece. “What I have to say is this.” His tone
was more magisterial than ever. “At present, my girl,
you are under age, and as long as you live with me the
law regards me as your guardian. And, as I have told
William already, in my opinion you are not a fit and
proper person to have the care of a thing so valuable
as this picture may prove to be. Mind you,”&mdash;the old
fox gave William a meaningful look&mdash;“I don’t go so
far as to say that it <i>is</i> valuable, but I say that it <i>might</i>
be. And, in that case, I can’t allow a mere ignorant
girl from the country who, in a manner of speaking,
doesn’t know the letter A from a pig’s foot to accept
it from you, my boy. It’s very generous of you, and
I hope she’s thanked you properly, but if I allow her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
to take it, some unscrupulous dealer is sure to bamboozle
her out of it. That’s assuming it’s valuable,
which, of course, I don’t go so far as to say that it is.”</p>

<p>“Thief!” stormed June. “Wicked thief!”</p>

<p>However, she knew well enough that it was a real
pity to let her feelings get the better of her; it enabled
the Old Crocodile to shine so much by comparison. He
addressed himself to William in his most sanctimonious
manner. For the good of all concerned, such a bee-yew-ti-ful
thing&mdash;it sickened June to see the old humbug
lift his eyes to heaven&mdash;must be cared for by him
personally. An uneducated mawkin could not hope to
appreciate a work of art of that quality, and if anything
happened to it, as in such hands something inevitably
must, William’s master would never be able to forgive
himself, he wouldn’t really!</p>

<p>The old man spoke so gently and so plausibly and
hovered at times so near to tears, that William would
have been less than human not to have been moved by
his words. Uncle Si had not the least difficulty in making
clear to his assistant that he was swayed by the
highest motives. His own private regard for the picture,
which, of course, William must know was intense,
did not enter into the case at all; but wisdom
and experience declared that until Monsieur Duponnet
of Paris had seen the picture it must remain in responsible
hands.</p>

<p>“But I tell you the picture’s mine, mine, mine!”
cried June.</p>

<p>No, the picture was William’s. That outstanding
fact was emphasized again in his master’s kindly
voice. Was he not William’s guardian also in the eyes
of the law? Not for a moment could he think of allowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
the young man in a fit of weak generosity to
give away a thing that might prove to be a real work
of art.</p>

<p>June was a little disappointed by William’s attitude
in the matter. The way in which he submitted to Uncle
Si did him no credit. Surely the picture was his to do
with as he chose; yet to judge by Uncle Si’s handling
of the affair the young man had no right to dispose of
it. June deplored this lack of spirit. He should have
fought for his own. At the same time, her mind was
tormented by the unpleasant thought that he really
wanted to revoke his gift.</p>

<p>The more she considered the position, the less she
liked it. She could not rid herself of a feeling that
she was playing an unworthy part. It was all very well
to regard her actions as strictly in William’s interest.
But were they? She was haunted by a sense of having
descended perilously near to the level of Uncle Si himself.</p>

<p>Anyhow, she had tried her best to outwit S. Gedge
Antiques. And he had outwitted her. There was no
disguising it. Both were playing the same game, the
same crooked game, and it seemed that Uncle Si, as
was only to be expected, was able to play it much better
than could she. The artful old fox had bested her
with her own weapons. Were they not equally unscrupulous?
Was not William the toy of both?</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the course of the next morning, June was informed
by Uncle Si, with his most sanctimonious
air that “he could not pass over her impudence, and that
she had better pack her box and go.” Moreover, that
force might be lent to this ukase, he sternly summoned
William from the lumber room, and ordered the young
man to help her down with her box as soon as it was
ready; and then he must fetch her a cab.</p>

<p>This was more than June had bargained for. She
was expecting to be kicked out; but she had not looked
for the process to be quite so summary. It did not
suit her plans at all.</p>

<p>“Get a room for yourself in a decent neighbourhood,”
said the old man. “Mrs. Runciman will know
of one, no doubt. You’ve money enough to keep you
while you look for work.”</p>

<p>June’s swift mind, however, saw instant disadvantages.
Secretly, she cherished the hope, a slender one,
no doubt, of being able to discover where the picture
was hid. Once, however, she left the house that hope
would vanish. And it was painfully clear that it was
Uncle Si’s recognition of this fact which now made
him so determined to be quit of her.</p>

<p>The old serpent was fully alive to what lay at the
back of her mind. He knew that so long as she slept
under his roof the picture could never be safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>She was shrewd enough to size up the position at
once. Reading the purpose in the heart of Uncle Si
she told him plainly that much as she disliked her
present address she did not propose to change it until
her lawful property had been restored to her.</p>

<p>“You are going to leave this place within an hour,
my girl, for good and all.”</p>

<p>“I shall not,” said June flatly. “Until you give me
the picture, I don’t intend to stir.”</p>

<p>“The picture is not yours. You are not a fit person
to have it. And if you don’t go quietly your box will
be put into the street.”</p>

<p>“Dare to touch my box again, and I shall go straight
to the police.”</p>

<p>Uncle Si didn’t care a straw for the police. She had
not the slightest claim upon him; in fact she was living
on his charity. As for the picture, it had nothing whatever
to do with the matter.</p>

<p>At this point it was that William came out in his
true colours. He had been standing by, unwilling witness
of these passages. Anxiously concerned, he could
no longer keep silent.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sir,” he said, stammering painfully,
and flushing deeply, “but if Miss June leaves
the house, I’m afraid I’ll have to go as well.”</p>

<p>This was a thunderbolt. S. Gedge Antiques opened
his mouth in wide astonishment. He gasped like a
carp. The atmospheric displacement was terrific.
Slowly the old man took off his “selling” spectacles,
and replaced them with his “buying” ones. Certainly
the effect was to make him look a shade less truculent,
but at the moment there was no other result. “Boy,
don’t talk like a fool,” was all he could say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>William, however, was not to be moved. He never
found it easy to make up his mind; for him to reach a
decision in things that mattered was a slow and trying
process. But the task achieved it was for good or ill.
His stammers and blushes were a little ludicrous, he
seemed near to tears, but the open hostility of his
master could not turn him an inch.</p>

<p>“Never in my born days did I hear the like.” S.
Gedge Antiques seethed like a vipers’ nest. “Boy,
you ought to be bled for the simples to let a paltry
hussy get round you in this way.”</p>

<p>“Give me the picture, Uncle Si,” cried the paltry
hussy, with a force that made him blink, “and I’ll take
precious good care you don’t see me again.”</p>

<p>The old man whinnied with rage. But he had not
the least intention of giving up the picture; nor had
he the least intention of giving up that which was
almost as valuable, the services of his right-hand man.
William was irreplaceable. And the instant his master
realised that this odd fellow was very much in earnest,
he saw that there was only one line to take. He must
temporize. With all the tact he could muster, and on
occasion the old man could muster a good deal, the
Old Crocodile proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>The “firing” of his niece should stand in abeyance
for the time being. He gave solemn warning, however,
that she must get a job right away, as his mind was
quite made up that he was not going to find house room
for the likes of her an hour longer than he could help.
As for the boy, of whom he had always held such a
high opinion ever since the day he had first picked him
out of the gutter and upon whom he had lavished a
father’s kindness, he was really quite at a loss&mdash;with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
snuffle of heart-melting pathos&mdash;to know how to put his
deeply wounded feelings into words.</p>

<p>For June, all the same, the upshot was victory. The
inevitable packing of her box could be postponed to
her own good time. But well she knew that the reprieve
was due to William and to him alone. It was
his splendidly timed intervention that had enabled her
to win the day.</p>

<p>The previous evening harsh thoughts of the Sawney
had crept into her heart. After giving her the picture,
surely it was his duty to take a stronger line upon the
rape of it. But that phase of weakness was forgotten
now. He had come out nobly. At a most critical
moment he had fought her battle; and he had fought
it with magical effect.</p>

<p>All was forgiven. He was O. K.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVI">XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> was dominated now by a single thought. By
hook or by crook she must get back the picture
before she left that house. If she failed to do so, she
would never see it again, and there would be an end
of all her hopes. Exactly what these hopes were she
did not venture to ask herself; in any case, they would
not have been easy to put into words. But she felt
in a vague way that William’s future and her own
were bound up in them.</p>

<p>It was clear that the picture was concealed somewhere
upon the premises, because Mr. Thornton and his
friend, M. Duponnet, were coming there the next day
to look at it. June was quick to realize that this fact
offered a measure of opportunity which, slender as it
was, must certainly be used. No other was in the least
likely to come her way.</p>

<p>Three o’clock on Thursday afternoon she had learned
already was the hour of the appointment. It was now
the afternoon of Wednesday. No matter what the
penalty, if flesh and blood could contrive it, she must
be present at this interview, and see what happened to
the treasure.</p>

<p>Despair heavy upon her, she lay awake the best part
of the night searching her mind for a plan of action.
But the quest seemed hopeless. Uncle Si could so easily
thwart any scheme she might evolve. And he would
not have a scruple. She must outwit him somehow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
but to outwit one of such cunning was a task for a
brain far stronger and nimbler than hers.</p>

<p>Lying up there in her comfortless bed, wild thoughts
flocking round her pillow like so many evil spirits, the
whole sorry affair was as haunting as a bad dream.
And, interwoven with it, in the most fantastic way, was
the shop below, and more particularly the Hoodoo,
the presiding genius, which now stood forth in June’s
mind as the replica of Uncle Si himself. He was surely
possessed by a devil, and this heathen joss as surely
embodied it.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning June rose early. She was in
a mood of desperation. Little sleep had come to her in
the long and dreary night hours. But, in spite of feeling
quite worn out, her determination to “best” Uncle
Si and regain her own property had not grown less.
No ray was to be seen anywhere, yet defiant of fate as
she still was, the time had not yet come to admit even
to herself that all was lost.</p>

<p>As dustpan and brush in hand she began the day’s
work, more than one reckless expedient crossed her
mind. In the last resort she might put the matter in
the hands of the police. If she could have counted on
William’s support, she would have been tempted to do
this, but the rub was, he could not be depended on at
all. Nobly as he had fought her recent battle, it was
clear that so far as the picture itself was concerned,
his sympathies were wholly with Uncle Si. Even if
he did not deny that the picture was her lawful property
he had certainly done his best to revoke his gift.</p>

<p>No, she would gain nothing by calling in the police.
She must find some other way. During the night a
wild plan had entered her mind. And if in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
of the morning no scheme more hopeful occurred to
her, she was now resolved to act upon it.</p>

<p>To this end, she began at once to throw dust in the
eyes of Uncle Si. At the breakfast table he was told
that she meant to spend the afternoon looking for a
job if, with a modest eye on her plate, “he had no
objection.”</p>

<p>The Old Crocodile had not the least objection. With
gusto he assured her that it was quite the best thing
she could do. Privately he assured himself that he
didn’t want her hanging around the place while he was
transacting business of great importance with Mr.
Thornton and Monsieur Duponnet. Ever in the forefront
of his mind was the fact that these gentlemen
were coming to see him at three o’clock.</p>

<p>About an hour before the time appointed the old fox
sent William on an errand which would keep him away
most of the afternoon. And further to ensure that
the coast should be quite clear, S. Gedge Antiques said
sharply to his niece, “Go and put on your hat, my girl,
and make yourself scarce. Get after that job you spoke
about. I won’t have you hanging around while these
gentlemen are here.”</p>

<p>June, however, had other views. And these, whatever
they were, she was at great pains not to disclose.
First she watched William go innocently forth on a
long bus ride to Richmond. Next she made sure that
Uncle Si was composing himself in his armchair for
his usual “forty winks” after dinner. And then she
proceeded boldly to develop her audacious design.</p>

<p>To start with, she crept into the front shop and surveyed
the Hoodoo. The quaintly hideous vase was
fully six feet tall, its body huge, its mouth wide. Was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
it possible to get inside? There was little doubt that
if she was able to do so, this curious monster was quite
large enough to conceal her.</p>

<p>She saw at once that the task before her was no
light one. But by the side of the Hoodoo, inscrutable
Providence had placed a genuine antique in the shape
of a gate-legged table, £4.19.6&mdash;a great bargain. The
sight of this was encouraging. She climbed onto it.
And then wedging the Hoodoo most cunningly between
the table and the wall, and artfully disposing her own
weight, so that the monster might not tip over, she
lowered herself with the caution and agility of a cat
into the roomy interior.</p>

<p>It was almost a feat for an acrobat, but she managed
it somehow. Keeping tight hold of the rim as she
swung both legs over, her feet touched bottom with the
vase still maintaining the perpendicular. The space
inside was ample, and without even the need to bend,
the top of her head was invisible. Near the top of the
vase, moreover, was the monster’s open mouth, a narrow
slit studded with teeth, which not only afforded a
means of ventilation, but also through which, to June’s
devout joy, she was able to peer.</p>

<p>For such a crowning boon on the part of Providence
she had every reason to feel grateful. So far everything
was miraculously right. Her daring had met
with more success than could have been hoped for.
One problem remained, however, which at that moment
she did not venture to look in the face. To get into
the vase was one thing; to get out of it would be quite
another.</p>

<p>No friendly table could avail her now. In ascending
that sheer and slippery face of painted metal-work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
she must not expect help from outside when the time
came to escape from her prison. Besides one incautious
movement might cause the whole thing to topple. And
if topple it did, the results would be dire.</p>

<p>This, however, was not the time to consider that
aspect of the case. Let her be thankful for a concealment
so perfect which allowed her to breathe and to
see without being seen or her presence suspected. For
such material benefits she must lift up her heart; and
hope for the best when the time came to get out. With
a sense of grim satisfaction she set herself “to lie
doggo,” and await the next turn in a game that was
full of peril.</p>

<p>It was not long before Uncle Si shambled into the
shop. June could see him quite clearly, as he came in
with that furtive air which she had learned to know so
well. First he took off his spectacles and applied to
them vigorously a red bandanna handkerchief. Then
he peered cautiously round to make sure that he was
alone.</p>

<p>June had not dared to hope that the picture was concealed
in the shop; and yet it offered every facility.
There were many nooks and crannies, and the whole
place was crammed with old pieces of furniture, bric-à-brac,
curios. But June had felt that S. Gedge Antiques
was not likely to run the risk of hiding his
treasure in the midst of these. She thought that his
bedroom, under lock and key, was the most likely place
of all.</p>

<p>Howbeit, with a sharp thrill, half torment, half delight,
she saw that this was not the case. Within a
few feet of the Hoodoo itself was an old oak chest
which Uncle Si cautiously drew aside. The very spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
whereon it had rested contained a loose board. He
took a small chisel from a drawer in the counter,
prised up the board and from beneath it took forth
the buried treasure.</p>

<p>Long and lovingly the old man looked at it, hugging
it to his breast more than once in the process, and as
he did so June was reminded irresistibly of the Miser
Gaspard in “Les Cloches des Corneville,” that famous
play she had once seen at the Theatre Royal, Blackhampton.
To hide such a thing in such a place was a
regular miser’s trick. It was just what she had expected
of him. Presently a grandfather clock, with a
Westminster Abbey face, “guaranteed Queen Anne,”
chimed the hour of three. June could scarcely breathe
for excitement. Her heart seemed to rise in her throat
and choke her.</p>

<p>At five minutes past three came Mr. Thornton and
Monsieur Duponnet. The Frenchman was a small and
dapper personage, with a keen eye and a neat imperial.
In manner he was much quieter than tradition exacts
of a Frenchman, but it was easy to tell that Uncle Si
was much impressed by him. Louis Quinze-legs, too,
was full of deference. That gentleman, whose face was
almost as foxy as that of Uncle Si himself, and about
whose lips a thin smile flitted perpetually, had an air
of tacit homage for the smallest remark of M. Duponnet,
who was clearly a man of great consequence if the
bearing of Mr. Thornton was anything to go by.</p>

<p>June, at the back of the shop, inside the Hoodoo and
her keen eyes hidden by its half-open jaws, which, in
addition to other advantages was partly masked by a
litter of bric-à-brac, was in a position to gain full
knowledge of all that passed between these three. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
begin with, S. Gedge Antiques ceremoniously handed
the picture to Louis Quinze-legs who, with a fine gesture,
handed it to Monsieur Duponnet.</p>

<p>The Frenchman examined the canvas back and front
through his own private glass, scratched portions of it
with his nail, pursed his lips, rubbed his nose, and no
doubt would have shrugged his shoulders had not that
been such a jejune thing for a Frenchman to do.</p>

<p>With a deference that was quite impressive, Mr.
Thornton and S. Gedge Antiques waited for M. Duponnet
to say something.</p>

<p>“Ze tail of ze R. is a little faint, hein!” was what he
said.</p>

<p>“But it is a tail, Mussewer,” said S. Gedge Antiques
in a robust voice.</p>

<p>“And it is an R,” said polite Mr. Thornton, as he
bent over the picture.</p>

<p>“You can bet your life on that,” said S. Gedge
Antiques.</p>

<p>M. Duponnet did not seem inclined to wager anything
so valuable as his life. After a little hesitation,
which involved further minute examination through
his glass, he was ready to take the ‘R’ for granted. But
he went on to deplore the fact that the picture was without
a pedigree.</p>

<p>“A pedigree, Mussewer!” It was now the turn of
S. Gedge Antiques to rub his nose.</p>

<p>M. Duponnet succinctly explained, with the air of a
man expounding a commonplace in the world of art,
that Van Roons were so few, their qualities so rare,
their monetary value so considerable, that as soon as
one came into the market its history was eagerly scrutinised.
And should one suddenly appear that previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
had not been known to exist it would have to
run the gauntlet of the most expert criticism.</p>

<p>“May be, Mussewer!” S. Gedge Antiques wagged a
dour head. “But that’s not going to alter the fact that
this be-yew-ti-ful thing is a genuine Van Roon.”</p>

<p>In a manner of speaking it would not, agreed M.
Duponnet, but it might detract considerably from its
market value.</p>

<p>“That’s as may be.” The old man suddenly assumed
quite a high tone.</p>

<p>M. Duponnet and Mr. Thornton took the picture to
the other side of the shop and conferred together.
So low were their voices that neither Uncle Si nor
June could hear a word of what passed between them.
Times and again they held the canvas to the light.
They laid it on a tallboys, and pored over it; they
borrowed the microscope of one another and made
great show of using it; and then finally Mr. Thornton
crossed the floor and said to Uncle Si, who was
handling a piece of Waterford glass with the most
pensive unconcern: “What’s your price, Mr. Gedge?”</p>

<p>“Heh?” said the old man, as if emerging from a
beautiful dream. “Price? You had better name one.”</p>

<p>Excitement at this point seemed to cause June’s
heart to stop beating.</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” said Mr. Thornton, “our friend,
M. Duponnet, is not quite convinced that it is a Van
Roon.”</p>

<p>“But there’s the signature.”</p>

<p>“It seems to have been touched up a bit.”</p>

<p>“Not by me,” said S. Gedge Antiques, austerely.</p>

<p>“We don’t think that for a moment,” said Mr.
Thornton, in a voice of honey. “But the signature is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
by no means so clear as it might be, and in the absence
of a pedigree M. Duponnet does not feel justified in
paying a big price.”</p>

<p>There was a pause while the old man indulged in a
dramatic change of spectacles. And then he said rather
sourly, in a tone that M. Duponnet could not fail to
hear: “Pedigree or no pedigree, I shall have no difficulty
in selling it. You know as well as I do, Mr.
Thornton, that American buyers are in the market.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Mr. Gedge,” said Mr. Thornton suavely.
And then while Uncle Si glared at both gentlemen as
if they had been caught with their hands in his pocket,
they conferred again together. This time it was M.
Duponnet who ended their discussion by saying: “Meester
Gedge, name your figure!”</p>

<p>“Figure?” said Uncle Si dreamily; and then in his
odd way he scratched his scrub of whisker with a
thumbnail and rubbed a forefinger down his long and
foxlike nose.</p>

<p>“Your price, Meester Gedge?”</p>

<p>“Mussewer!” said the old man solemnly, “I couldn’t
take less than five thousand pounds, I couldn’t really.”</p>

<p>June held her breath. For some little time past she
had been convinced that the picture was valuable, but
she was hardly prepared for this fabulous sum.</p>

<p>M. Duponnet shook his head. “Meester Gedge, if
only we had its ’istory!”</p>

<p>“If we had its history, Mussewer, I should want at
least twice the money. Even as it is I am taking a big
chance. You know that as well as I do.”</p>

<p>This seemed to be true. At all events, M. Duponnet
and Mr. Thornton again talked earnestly together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Once more they fingered that rather dilapidated canvas.
Head to head they bent over it yet again; and then
suddenly M. Duponnet looked up and came abruptly
across to the old man.</p>

<p>“Meester Gedge,” he said, “I can’t go beyond four
t’ousand pounds. That is my limit!”</p>

<p>“Five, Mussewer Duponny, that is mine,” said Uncle
Si, with a dark smile.</p>

<p>It was a jejune thing for a French gentleman to do,
but at this point M. Duponnet really and truly gave his
shoulders a shrug, and advanced three paces towards
the shop door. Uncle Si did not stir a muscle. And
then M. Duponnet faced about and said: “Guineas,
Meester Gedge, I’ll give four t’ousand guineas, and
that’s my last word.”</p>

<p>Uncle Si having no pretensions to be considered a
French gentleman, did not hesitate to give his own
shoulders a shrug. It was his turn then to confer with
the discreet and knowledgeable Mr. Thornton, who it
was clear was acting the difficult part of a go-between.</p>

<p>June heard that gentleman say in an audible whisper:
“A fair price, Mr. Gedge, for the thing as it stands.
It hasn’t a pedigree, and to me that signature looks a
bit doubtful. In the market it may fetch more or it
may fetch less, but at the same time four thousand
guineas is a fine insurance.”</p>

<p>Finished dissembler as Uncle Si was, even he did
not seek to deny the truth of this. There could be no
gainsaying that four thousand guineas <i>was</i> a fine insurance.
True, if the picture proved to be a veritable
Van Roon it might fetch many times that sum. In that
shrewd mind, no bigger miracle was needed for the
thing to turn out a <i>chef d’œuvre</i> than that it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
prove to be worth the sum offered by M. Duponnet.
Either contingency seemed too good to be true. Besides,
S. Gedge Antiques belonged to a conservative
school, among whose articles of faith was a certain
trite proverb about a bird in the hand.</p>

<p>It went to the old man’s heart to accept four thousand
guineas for a work that might be worth so very
much more. June could hear him breathing heavily.
In her tense ear that sound dominated even the furious
beating of her own heart. A kind of dizziness came
over her, as only too surely she understood that the
wicked old man was giving in. Before her very eyes
he was going to surrender her own private property for
a fabulous sum.</p>

<p>“Four t’ousand guineas, Meester Gedge,” said M.
Duponnet, with quite an air of nonchalance. But he
knew well enough that the old man was about to “fall.”</p>

<p>“It’s giving it away, Mussewer,” whined Uncle Si.
“It’s giving it away.”</p>

<p>“Zat I don’t t’ink, Meester Gedge,” said the French
gentleman, quietly unbuttoning his coat and taking a
fountain pen and a cheque book from an inner pocket.
“It’s a risque&mdash;a big risque. It may not be Van Roon
at all&mdash;and zen where are we?”</p>

<p>“You know as well as I do that it’s a Van Roon,”
Uncle Si verged almost upon tears.</p>

<p>“Very well, Meester Gedge, if you prefer ze big
chance.” And cheque book in hand the French gentleman
paused.</p>

<p>June was torn. And she could tell by the strange
whine in the rasping voice that the Old Crocodile was
also torn.</p>

<p>At this moment of crisis, Mr. Thornton interposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
with masterful effect. “In my humble opinion,” he
said, “it’s a very fair offer for the thing as it stands.”</p>

<p>“You are thinking of your ten per cent. commission,
my boy,” said S. Gedge Antiques with a gleam of
malice.</p>

<p>“Well, Meester Gedge,” said M. Duponnet, “take it
or leave it.” And the French gentleman began to fold
up his cheque book.</p>

<p>With a groan to rend a heart of stone, S. Gedge
Antiques brought himself suddenly to accept the offer.
Half suffocated by excitement, June watched M. Duponnet
cross to the desk and proceed to write out a
cheque for four thousand guineas. And as she did
so her heart sank. She was quite sure that she was
looking upon the picture for the last time.</p>

<p>In jumping to this conclusion, however, she had
not made full allowance for the business capacity of
Uncle Si. When M. Duponnet had filled in the cheque
and handed it to him, the Old Crocodile scrutinised it
very carefully indeed, and then he said: “Thank you,
Mussewer Duponny. The bank closes at three. But
to-morrow morning I’ll take this round myself as soon
as it opens. And if the manager says it’s all right,
you can have the picture whenever you like.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bien!</i>” The Frenchman bowed politely. “Meanwhile,
take good care of the picture. There are many
thieves about.” M. Duponnet laughed. “Mind you
lock it up in a safe place.”</p>

<p>“You can trust Mr. Gedge to do that, I think,” said
Louis Quinze-legs dryly.</p>

<p>“I hope so, I’m sure,” said the old man with a frosty
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Soit!</i>” M. Duponnet smiled too. “I’ll call for it
myself to-morrow morning at twelve.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mussewer!”</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques gave his visitors a bow as they
went up to the shop door, and ushered them ceremoniously
into the not particularly inviting air of New
Cross Street.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ust</span> at first June was unable to realise that M.
Duponnet had not taken the picture away with him.
The blood seemed to drum against her brain while
she watched Uncle Si turn over the cheque in his long
talon fingers and then transfer it to a leather case,
which he returned to his breast pocket with a deep sigh.
Afterwards he took up the picture from the table on
which he had set it down and then June grasped the
fact that the treasure was still there.</p>

<p>The face which bent over it now was not that of a
happy man. It was a complex of emotions, deep and
stern. The price was huge for a thing that had cost
him nothing, but&mdash;and there it was that the shoe
pinched!&mdash;if it should prove to be a real Van Roon,
he might be parting with it for a song.</p>

<p>June could read his thoughts like an open book. He
wanted to eat his cake and have it too. She would
have been inclined to pity him had her hatred and her
scorn been less. In his cunning and his greed he was a
tragic figure, with a thing of incomparable beauty in
his hand whose sole effect was to give him the look of
an evil bird of prey. Utter rascal as she knew him to
be now, she shivered to think how easy it would be
for herself to grow just like him. Her very soul was
fixed upon the recovery of this wonderful thing which,
in the first place, she had obtained by a trick. And
did she covet it for its beauty? Or was it for the reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
which at this moment made Uncle Si a creature so ill to
look upon? To such questions there could only be one
answer.</p>

<p>For the time being, however, these things were
merged in the speculation far more momentous: What
will the Old Crocodile do now? She was feeling so
uncomfortable in her narrow hiding place, which prevented
all movement, and almost forbade her to breathe,
that she hoped devoutly the old wretch would lose no
time in putting back the treasure.</p>

<p>This, alas, was not to be. The picture was still in
the hand of Uncle Si, who still pored over it like a
moulting vulture, when a luxurious motor glided up
to the shop door. Almost at once the shop was invaded
by two persons, who in the sight of June had a look of
notable importance.</p>

<p>The first of these, whom June immediately recognised,
was the tall, fashionable girl whose visit had
caused her such heart-burning the week before. She
was now accompanied by a gentleman who beyond a
doubt was her distinguished father.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Gedge!” It was twenty past
three by the afternoon, but June was ready to take a
Bible oath that Miss Blue Blood said “good morning.”
“I’ve persuaded my father to come and look at this
amazing vase.” And with her <i>en-tout-cas</i> Miss Blue
Blood pointed straight at the Hoodoo.</p>

<p>Feeling herself to be a rat caught neatly in a trap,
June at once crouched lower. The Hoodoo being fully
six feet tall and her own stoop considerable, she was
able to take comfort from the fact that just then no
part of her own head was showing. But how long was
she likely to remain invisible? That was a question for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
the gods. And it was further complicated by the knowledge
that the Hoodoo’s mouth was open, and that the
point of Miss Blue Blood’s green umbrella might easily
find a way through.</p>

<p>A-shiver with fear June tried to subdue her wild
heart, while Miss Babraham, her father, Sir Arthur,
and S. Gedge Antiques gathered round the Hoodoo.
She hardly dared to breathe. The least sound would
betray her. And in any case, one of the three had
merely to stand on an adjacent coffin stool and peer
over the top for the murder to be out.</p>

<p>The tragedy which June so clearly foresaw was not
permitted to take place at once. Plainly the fates were
inclined to toy with their victim for a while. Miss
Blue Blood’s laugh&mdash;how rich and deep it was!&mdash;rang
in her ears and made them burn as she gave the Hoodoo
a prod and cried out in her gay Miss-Banks-like manner,
“Papa, I ask you, did you ever see anything quite
like it?”</p>

<p>“By George, no!” laughed that connoisseur.</p>

<p>“It’s such a glorious monster,” said his enthusiastic
daughter standing on tiptoe, “that one can’t even see
over the top.”</p>

<p>“Puts one in mind,” said Sir Arthur, “of the Arabian
Nights and the Cave of the Forty Robbers.”</p>

<p>“The long gallery at Homefield is the very place for
it!”</p>

<p>“I wonder!” The connoisseur tapped the Hoodoo
with his walking stick and turned to S. Gedge Antiques.
“Do you happen to know where it came from?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“From a Polynesian temple in the South Sea Islands,
I believe, sir,” said Uncle Si, glibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“What do you want for it?” And Sir Arthur tapped
the Hoodoo again.</p>

<p>“I’ll take thirty pounds, sir.” It was the voice of a
man bringing himself to part with a valuable tooth.
“Sixty was the sum I paid for it some years ago.
But it isn’t everybody’s fancy, and it swallows a small
place.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur observed with pleasant humour that such
a monstrosity ought to be taken over by the nation.
S. Gedge Antiques, with a humour that strove to be
equally pleasant, concurred.</p>

<p>At this point, to June’s mortal terror, Miss Babraham
made a second attempt to look over the top.</p>

<p>“Stand on this coffin stool, Miss,” said S. Gedge
Antiques, politely producing that article from the collection
of bric-à-brac around the Hoodoo.</p>

<p>June’s heart stood still. The game was up. Sickly
she closed her eyes. But Providence had one last card
to play.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” said Miss Babraham. “But
it won’t bear my weight, I’m afraid. No, I don’t
think I’ll risk it. There’s really nothing to see inside.”</p>

<p>Uncle Si agreed that there was really nothing to see
inside; and June breathed again.</p>

<p>“Thirty pounds isn’t much, papa, for such a glorious
monstrosity.” Miss Blue Blood had evidently set her
heart on it.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur, however, expressed a fear that a thing
of that size, that hue, that contour would kill every
object in the Long Gallery. Great argument ensued.
And then to June’s relief, Miss Babraham, her father,
Sir Arthur and S. Gedge Antiques, arguing still, moved
away from the Hoodoo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>The upshot was that Sir Arthur, overborne at last
by the force of his daughter’s reasoning, agreed to buy
the monster, for what in the opinion of the seller, was
a ridiculously inadequate sum. It was to be carefully
packed in a crate, and sent down to Homefield near
Byfleet, Surrey. So much for the Hoodoo. And then
the eye of a famous connoisseur lit on the picture that
the old dealer had laid on the gate-legged table.</p>

<p>“What have we here?” said Sir Arthur, fixing his
eyeglass.</p>

<p>Uncle Si became a sphinx. The connoisseur took
the picture in his hand, and while he examined it with
grave curiosity he too became a sphinx. So tense grew
the silence to June’s ear that again she was troubled
by the loud beating of her heart.</p>

<p>At last the silence was broken by the light and
charming note of Miss Babraham. “Why, surely,”
she said, “that is the funny old picture I saw when I
was here the other day.”</p>

<p>“We have cleaned it up a bit since then, madam,”
said Uncle Si in a voice so toneless that June could
only marvel at the perfect self-command of this arch
dissembler.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur, it was clear, was tremendously interested.
He turned the picture over and over, and used the
microscope very much as M. Duponnet had done.
Finally he said in a voice nearly as toneless as that
of Uncle Si himself. “What do you ask for this, Mr.
Gedge?”</p>

<p>“Not for sale, sir,” was the decisive answer.</p>

<p>The nod of Sir Arthur implied that it was the
answer he expected. “Looks to me a fine example.”
A true amateur, he could not repress a little sigh of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
pleasure. There was no concealing the fact that he
was intrigued.</p>

<p>“Van Roon at his best, sir,” said S. Gedge Antiques.</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” said the connoisseur&mdash;in the tone of the
connoisseur. “One would be rather inclined to say so.
If the question is not impertinent,”&mdash;Sir Arthur fixed
a steady eye upon the face of deep cunning which confronted
his&mdash;“may I ask where it came from?”</p>

<p>The old man was prepared for the question. His
answer was pat. “I can’t tell you that, sir,” he said,
in a tone of mystery.</p>

<p>Again Sir Arthur nodded. That, too, was the answer
he had expected. In the pause which followed Sir
Arthur returned to a loving re-examination of the picture;
and then said S. Gedge Antiques in a voice
gravely and quietly confidential: “Strictly between ourselves,
sir, I may say that I have just turned down an
offer of five thousand guineas.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;indeed!”</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the Old Crocodile to gaze
into the impassive countenance of the famous connoisseur.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“F</span>ive</span> thousand guineas, sir, I have just refused,”
said Uncle Si, “for this little thing, as sure as
God’s in the sky.”</p>

<p>So shocked was June by this adding of blasphemy to
his other crimes, that she shivered audibly. Miss
Babraham cocked up her head at the sound. “You’ve
a cat somewhere, haven’t you?” she said, looking
around the shop.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” said Uncle Si shortly. So like a
woman to butt in at such a moment with such a remark!</p>

<p>“In my humble opinion,” said Sir Arthur, gazing
solemnly at the picture, “this is a finer example of Van
Roon than the one&mdash;and the only one!&mdash;we have in
the National Gallery.”</p>

<p>“There, sir, I am with you,” said S. Gedge Antiques
with unction.</p>

<p>“One would like to know its history.”</p>

<p>The old man became a sphinx once more. “I can
only tell you, sir, I didn’t buy it as a Van Roon,” he
said cautiously.</p>

<p>“Really!” Sir Arthur grew more intrigued than ever.
“Well, Mr. Gedge, whatever you bought it as, I think
there can be no doubt that you’ve made a lucky purchase.”</p>

<p>“I am wondering, sir,” said S. Gedge Antiques,
“whether the National Gallery would care to acquire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
this fine example?” It was a sudden inspiration, but
those measured tones and calculating eyes gave no indication
of the fact.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Babraham, in his own capacity of a
National Gallery trustee, began sensibly to moderate
his transports. “More unlikely things, Mr. Gedge,”
at last he brought himself reluctantly to say. “Van
Roons are very scarce, and if this one is all that he
appears to be at a first glance, it will be a pity to let
him leave the country.”</p>

<p>Piously, S. Gedge Antiques thought so, too.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur turned to the picture again. Like M.
Duponnet he seemed to have difficulty in keeping his
expert gaze off that fascinating canvas.</p>

<p>“Reminds one,” he said, “of that choice thing that
was stolen from the Louvre about twenty-five years
ago. The size is similar and, as I remember it, the
whole composition is in some ways identical.”</p>

<p>The old man was startled, but not visibly. “Was
there one stolen from the Loov, sir?” he said, with a
polite air of asking for information.</p>

<p>“Why, yes! Don’t you remember? There was a
great stir at the time. It was cut out of its frame.
The French Government offered a big reward, but the
work has never been recovered.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir.” All at once the Old Crocodile began
to gambol a little. “Let’s hope this ain’t the boy.”
He gave a mild snigger. But as his next words proved
there was more in that snigger than met the ear. “In
the event of this little jool turning out to be stolen property,
what, sir, do you suppose would be the position of
the present owner?”</p>

<p>“Difficult to say, Mr. Gedge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“He’d receive compensation, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Substantial compensation one would think&mdash;if he
was able to prove his title.”</p>

<p>If he was able to prove his title! Those blunt little
words had a sinister sound for S. Gedge Antiques, but
he did not turn a hair. “No difficulty about that, sir,”
he said, robustly.</p>

<p>“Quite!” Evidently Sir Arthur had no doubt upon
the point. “But as the question might arise it may be
well to have it settled before disposing of the picture.”</p>

<p>S. Gedge agreed.</p>

<p>“And in any case, before parting with it,” said Sir
Arthur, “it will be wise, I think, to take advice.”</p>

<p>Again S. Gedge agreed. “You mean, sir, it may be
very valuable indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I quite think it may be. At a cursory glance
it has the look of a fine example of a great master. I
remember at the time that ‘L’Automne’ disappeared
from the Louvre, it was said to be worth at least two
hundred and fifty thousand francs, and since then Van
Roons have more than doubled in price.”</p>

<p>“In that case, sir”&mdash;there was a tremor of real emotion
in the voice of the old dealer&mdash;“this be-yew-ti-ful
thing ought not to be allowed to leave the country.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately the French authorities may compel
it to do so.” And the connoisseur sighed as he fingered
the canvas lovingly.</p>

<p>Affirmed S. Gedge Antiques: “I don’t believe, sir,
for a moment that it is ‘L’Automne.’”</p>

<p>“One wouldn’t like to say it is,” said the cautious
Sir Arthur. “And one wouldn’t like to say it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be up to the Loov to prove it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Quite. In the meantime, before you let it go, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
hope you’ll give me an opportunity of looking at it
again.”</p>

<p>This modest request caused the old man to rub his
nose. He was not in a position, he said mysteriously, to
give a promise, but certainly he would do his best to
meet the wishes of Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Gedge. If this picture is not
claimed by other people, and of course one doesn’t for
a moment suggest that it will be, steps might be taken
to keep it here. We are so poor in Van Roons&mdash;there
is only one, I believe&mdash;to our shame!&mdash;in this country
at the present time&mdash;that we can’t afford to let a thing
like this slip through our fingers. Therefore, as I
say, before you decide to sell I hope you’ll take advice.”</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques gravely thanked Sir Arthur Babraham.
He would keep those wise words in mind.
And in the meantime he would pack <i>That</i> in a crate&mdash;he
pointed a finger straight at June’s eyes&mdash;and send
it to Homefield.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash;near Byfleet, Surrey, I think you said, sir?”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> distinguished visitors were bowed into the
street. And then S. Gedge Antiques, with the
face of a man whose soul is in torment, returned to
contemplation of the picture, and also of M. Duponnet’s
cheque which he took out of his pocket book. It was
clear that his mind was the prey of a deep problem.
The bird in the hand was well enough so far as it went,
but the bird in the bush was horribly tempting.</p>

<p>At last with a heavy sigh the old man returned the
cheque to his pocket, and then cautiously lifting up the
loose board, put back the picture whence it came and
drew the oak chest over the spot. He then shambled
off to the room next door, which was full of odds and
ends mingled with a powerful smell of oil and varnish.</p>

<p>June at once made an attempt to get out of prison.
But she now found her position to be as she had already
surmised. To enter without help had been no mean
feat, to escape in the same fashion was impossible.
Wedged so tightly inside the Hoodoo, there was neither
play nor purchase for her hands; and frantic as her
efforts were, they were yet subordinated to the knowledge
that it would be quite easy for the thing to topple
over. Should that happen the consequence would certainly
be alarming and possibly ghastly.</p>

<p>Frantically wriggling in the jaws of the Hoodoo, it
did not matter what she did, she was firmly held. And
the fear of Uncle Si, who was pottering about quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
close at hand, while imposing silence upon her, intensified
the growing desperation of her case. She was a
mouse in a trap.</p>

<p>Too soon did she learn that only one course was
open to her. She must wait for William’s return. Irksome
and humiliating as the position was, it was clear
that she could do nothing without help.</p>

<p>Would William never come? The minutes ticked on
and her durance grew exceedingly vile. She became
conscious of pains in her shoulders and feet, she felt
as if she could hardly draw breath, her head throbbing
with excitement seemed as if it must burst. It was a
horrible fix to be in.</p>

<p>Suffering acutely now, she yielded as well as she
could to the inevitable. There was simply nothing to
be done. She must wait. It was imprisonment in a
most unpleasant form and she was frightened by the
knowledge that it might continue many hours. Even
when William did return, and there was no saying
when he would do so, he was quite as likely to enter
by the back door as by the shop. So terrible was the
thought that June felt ready to faint at the bare idea.</p>

<p>This was a matter, however, in which fate was not
so relentless after all. June was doing her best to bear
up in the face of this new and paralysing fear when
the shop door opened and lo! William came in.</p>

<p>Great was her joy, and yet it had to be tempered by
considerations of prudence. She contrived to raise
her lips to the mouth of the Hoodoo, and to breathe
his name in a tragic whisper.</p>

<p>As he heard her and turned, she urged in the same
odd fashion: “For Heaven’s sake&mdash;not a sound!”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;Miss June!” he gasped. “Where are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>She checked him with wild whisperings that yet
served to draw him to her prison.</p>

<p>He was dumbfounded, quite as much as by her
fiercely tragic voice as by the amazing predicament in
which he found her.</p>

<p>“Help me out!” she commanded him. “And don’t
make the least sound. Uncle Si is next door, and if
he finds me here, something terrible will happen.”</p>

<p>Such force and such anxiety had one at least of the
results so much to be desired. They forbade the asking
of futile questions. Every moment was precious if she
was to make good her escape.</p>

<p>William in this crisis proved himself a right good
fellow. His sense of the ludicrous was keen, but he
stifled it. Moreover, a legitimate curiosity had been
fully aroused, but he stifled that also as he proceeded
to carry out these imperious orders. But even with
such ready and stalwart help, June was to learn again
that it was no easy matter to escape from the Hoodoo.</p>

<p>Without venturing to speak again, William mounted
the gate-legged table and offered both hands to the
prisoner. But the trouble was that she was so tightly
pinned that she could not raise hers to receive them.
And it was soon fatally clear that so long as the Hoodoo
kept the perpendicular it would be impossible for
any external agent to secure a hold upon the body
wedged within its jaws.</p>

<p>After several attempts at dislodgement had miserably
failed, June gasped in a kind of anguish: “Do
you think you can tip this thing over&mdash;very gently&mdash;without
making a sound?”</p>

<p>This was trying William highly indeed, but it seemed
the only thing to be done. Happily he was tall and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
strong; much was said, all the same, for his power of
muscle and the infinite tact with which it was applied
that he was able to tilt the Hoodoo on to its end.
Keeping the vase firmly under control, he then managed
to regulate its descent to the shop floor so skilfully as
to avoid a crash.</p>

<p>Such a feat was really a triumph of applied dynamics.
June, however, was not in a position to render it all
the homage it deserved, even if she was deeply grateful
for the address that William brought to bear upon his
task. Once the Hoodoo had been laid full length on
the shop floor she was able to wriggle her body and her
shoulders with what violence she pleased, without the
fear of disaster. A series of convulsive twists and
writhings and she was free!</p>

<p>As soon as she knew that she was no longer pinned
by the jaws of the monster, the action of a strong mind
was needed to ward off a threat of hysteria. But she
controlled herself sufficiently to help William restore
the Hoodoo to the perpendicular; and then she said in
a whisper of extreme urgency which was barely able
to mask the sob of nerves overstrung: “Not one word
now. But go straight into the kitchen&mdash;just as if
you hadn’t seen me. And remember whatever happens”&mdash;the
whisper grew fiercer, the sob more imminent&mdash;“if
Uncle Si asks the question you <i>haven’t</i> seen
me. I’m supposed to be looking for a job. You
understand?”</p>

<p>To say that William did understand would have been
to pay him a most fulsome compliment; yet the stout
fellow behaved as if the whole of this amazing matter
was as clear as daylight. Such was June’s fixity of will,
the sheer force of her personality, that he left the shop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
at once like a man hypnotised. Excited questions
trembled upon his lips, but in the face of this imperiousness
he did not venture to give them play.</p>

<p>He made one attempt&mdash;one half-hearted attempt.</p>

<p>“But Miss June&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>The only answer of Miss June was to cram one hand
over his mouth, and with the other to propel him
towards the door which led to the back premises.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> soon as William had passed out of the shop,
June stood a moment to gather nerve and energy
for the task before her. Feeling considerably tossed,
above all she was devoured by a horrible form of excitement
whose effect was like nothing so much as a
bad dream. But this was not a time for dreams. The
situation was full of peril; not a moment must be lost.</p>

<p>The picture was her immediate concern. She set
herself at once to the business of moving the oak chest
aside. This presented no difficulty, for there was
nothing in it; but the loose board beneath it did.
Fingers unhelped could not prise it up; they must have
a chisel. She knew that such an implement was to be
found in one of the drawers of the desk, but she had
stealthily to open three or four before she came upon
the right one.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, she could hear the voices
of William and Uncle Si in the room next door. It
seemed that no matter what her caution or her haste,
she would almost certainly be interrupted before she
was through with her task. But luck was with her.
She was able to lift the board, take forth the picture,
replace the chest and return the chisel to its drawer
without the voices coming any nearer.</p>

<p>Picture in hand, she tiptoed out of the shop as far
as the stairs. Through the open door of the inner room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
the back of Uncle Si was visible as she crept by. It
was taking a grave risk to attempt the stairs at such a
moment, but she was wrought up to a point when to go
back and wait was impossible. She must continue to
chance her luck.</p>

<p>Up the stairs she crept, expecting at every second
one to hear a harsh voice recall her. To her unspeakable
relief, however, she was able to gain sanctuary in
her own room without hindrance. She bolted the door
against the enemy, although so far as she was aware,
he was still in the room below in total ignorance of
what had happened.</p>

<p>Shivering as if in the throes of fever, she sat on the
edge of her narrow bed. The treasure was hers still.
She held it to her bosom as a mother holds a child; yet
the simple act gave rise at once to the problem of problems:
What must be done with the thing now? There
could be no security for it under that roof. And not
to the picture alone did this apply, but also to herself.
Anything might happen as soon as the old man found
out that the Van Roon was not, after all, to be his.
Meanwhile, the future hardly bore thinking about; it
was like a precipice beyond whose edge she dare not
look.</p>

<p>One act, however, did not admit of a moment’s
delay: there and then the treasure must be smuggled
out of the house and put in a place of safety. Rowelled
by this thought, June rose from the bed, took a piece
of brown paper and some string from her box, and
proceeded to transform the picture into a neat parcel.
She then slipped off her dress, which was considerably
the worse for contact with the dusty interior of the
Hoodoo, performed a hasty toilette, put on her walking-out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
coat and skirt and changed her shoes. Finally,
she put on the better of the only two hats she possessed,
slipped her mother’s battered old leather purse into her
coat pocket, and then, umbrella in one hand, parcel in
the other, she turned to the hazard of stealing downstairs
and making good her escape.</p>

<p>In the middle of the twisty stairs, just before their
sharpest bend would bring her into the view of persons
below, she stopped to listen. The voices had ceased;
she could not hear a sound. Two ways lay before her
of reaching the street: one via the parlour to the
kitchen and out along the side entry, the other through
the front door of the shop. Either route might be
commanded at the moment by the enemy. With nothing
to guide her, June felt that the only safe course
just then was to stay where she was. In the strategic
position she had taken up on the stairs she could not be
seen from below, yet a quick ear might hope to gain a
clue to what was going on.</p>

<p>She had not to wait long. From the inner room,
whose door opposite the foot of the stairs was still half
open, although its occupant was no more seen, there
suddenly came the strident tones of Uncle Si. They
were directed unmistakably kitchenward. “Boy, you’d
better get the tea ready. Seemin’ly that gell ain’t
home.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” came a prompt and cheerful response
from the back premises.</p>

<p>June decided at once that the signs were favourable.
Now was her chance; the way through the front shop
was evidently clear. Deftly as a cat she came down
the remaining stairs and stole past the half-open door
of what was known as “the lumber room,” where, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
old chairs were sometimes fitted with new legs
and old chests with new panels.</p>

<p>Uncle Si was undoubtedly there. June could hear
him moving about as she passed the door; indeed she
was hardly clear of it when she received a most unwelcome
reminder of this fact. Either he chanced to
turn round as she crept by, or he caught a glimpse of
her passing in one of the numerous mirrors that surrounded
him. For just as she reached the shop
threshold she heard his irascible bark: “That you,
niece?”</p>

<p>The road clear ahead, June did not pause to weigh
consequences. She simply bolted. Even if the old man
was not likely to guess what her neat parcel contained,
it would surely be the height of folly to give him the
chance.</p>

<p>Never in her life had she been quite so thankful as
when she found herself in the street with the treasure
safely under her arm.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> went swiftly down New Cross Street to the
Strand. Until she reached that garish sea of
traffic she dare not look back lest hot on her heels
should be Uncle Si. Such a discovery was not at all
likely she well knew; the feeling was therefore illogical,
yet she could not rid herself of it until she was merged
in the ever-flowing tide.</p>

<p>Taking refuge at last in a jeweller’s doorway from
the maelstrom of passers by, June had now another
problem to face. The Van Roon must find a home.
But the question of questions was&mdash;where?</p>

<p>Apart from William and Uncle Si, and her chance
acquaintance, Mr. Keller, she did not know a soul in
London. Mr. Keller, however, sprang at once to her
mind. Yet more than one reservation promptly arose
in regard to him. She knew really nothing about him
beyond the fact that he was a man of obviously good
address, belonging to a class superior to her own. He
was a man of the world, of a certain breeding and education,
but whether it would be wise to trust a comparative
stranger in such a matter seemed exceedingly
doubtful to a girl of June’s horse sense. Still there
was no one else to whom she could turn. And recalling
the circumstances of their first meeting, if one could
ignore the means by which it had come about, there was
something oddly compelling, something oddly attractive,
about this Mr. Keller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>In the total absence of other alternatives, June found
her mind drawn so far in the direction of this man
of mystery that at last she took from her purse a slip
of paper on which he had written his name and address:
“Adolph Keller, No. 4, Haliburton Studios, Manning
Square, Soho.”</p>

<p>Could she trust him with the care of a Van Roon?
Now that she had been a witness of its terrible effect
on Uncle Si, she was forced to ask whether it would
be right to trust any man with such a talisman. Luckily,
the world was not peopled exclusively with Uncle Sis.
She would have to trust somebody with her treasure,
that was certain; and, after all, there was no reason to
suspect that Mr. Keller was not an honest man.</p>

<p>She was still in the jeweller’s doorway, wrestling
with the pros and cons of the tough matter, when a
passing bus displaying the name Victoria Station
caught her eye. In a flash came the solution of the
problem.</p>

<p>Again she entered the sea of traffic, to be borne slowly
along by the slow tide as far as Charing Cross. Here
she waited for another bus to Victoria. The solving of
the riddle was absurdly simple after all. What place
for her treasure could be safer, more accessible than a
railway station cloak room?</p>

<p>She boarded Bus 23. But hardly had it turned the
corner into Whitehall when a thin flicker of elation was
dashed by the salutary thought that her brain was giving
out. The cloak room at Charing Cross, from the
precincts of whose station she had just driven away,
was equally adapted to her need. Along the entire
length of Whitehall and Victoria Street she was
haunted by the idea that she was losing her wits. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
prolonged scrutiny of her pale but now collected self
in a confectioner’s window on the threshold of the
London and Brighton terminus was called for to reassure
her. And even then, for a girl so shrewd and
so practical, there remained the scar of a distressing
mental lapse.</p>

<p>It did not take long to deposit the parcel in the cloak
room on the main line down platform. But in the act
of doing so, occurred a slight incident which was destined
to have a bearing on certain events to follow.
When a ticket was handed to her, she could only meet
the charge of three pence with a ten shilling note.</p>

<p>“Nothing smaller, Miss?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I haven’t,” said June, searching her
purse, and then carefully placing the ticket in its middle
compartment.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait while I get change then.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to trouble you,” June murmured, as the
clerk went out through a door into an inner office. Ever
observant and alert, she noticed that the clerk was a
tallish young man, whose freely curling fair hair put
her in mind of William, and that he wore a new suit of
green corduroy.</p>

<p>The likeness to William gave <i>bouquet</i> to her politeness,
when the young man returned with the change.
“Sorry to give you so much trouble,” she said again.</p>

<p>“No trouble, miss.” And Green Corduroy handed
the change across the cloak room counter with a frank
smile that was not unworthy of William himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXII">XXXII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> treasure in a safe place, June had to consider
what to do next. One fact stood out clear in
her mind. She must leave at once the sheltering roof
of S. Gedge Antiques. There was no saying what
would happen when the Old Crocodile discovered that
the Van Roon was missing.</p>

<p>The sooner she collected her box and her gear, and
found another lodging the better. Her best plan would
be to go back to New Cross Street and get them now.
Uncle Si was hardly likely as yet to have made the
discovery. It would be wise, therefore, to take advantage
of this lull, for at the most it was only a matter
of a few hours before the truth was known. And when
known it was, Number Forty-six New Cross Street
was the very last place in London in which she would
choose to be.</p>

<p>There was a chance, of course, that “the murder”
was out already. But she would have to take the risk
of that. All that she had in the world beyond the six
paper pounds, nine shillings and ninepence in her purse,
was in the box in the garret. Her entire resources were
about seventeen pounds in money, a scanty wardrobe,
and a few odds and ends of jewellery of little value, but
if she could get hold of these they might suffice to tide
her over a sorely anxious time.</p>

<p>In the present state of her nerves, courage was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
needed to return to New Cross Street. But it had to
be. And it was now or never. If her box was to be
got away, she must go boldly back at once and claim
it. How this was to be done without arousing suspicion
she did not quite know, but the most hopeful method
was to announce that she had been able to find a job,
and also good lodgings, and that she did not care to
lay the burden of her presence upon Uncle Si one
hour longer than was necessary.</p>

<p>She had been brought up with a strict regard for the
truth, but fate was driving her so hard that she could
not afford to have scruples. Hanging by a strap on the
Underground to Charing Cross, which seemed the
quickest route, and time was the essence of the matter,
she rehearsed the part she had now to play. Certainly
the playing itself would not lack gusto. Nothing life
so far had given her would yield quite so much pleasure
as saying good-bye to the Old Crocodile, and ironically
thanking him for all his kindness. At the same time,
the job and lodgings story must be pitched in just the
right key, or his suspicions would be aroused, and then
something horribly unpleasant might occur.</p>

<p>By the time June had turned out of the Strand into
New Cross Street, a heavy autumnal dusk had fallen
upon that bleak thoroughfare. Somehow the dark pall
struck at her heart. In a sense it was symbolical of the
business upon which she was engaged. She felt like a
thief whose instinct welcomes darkness, and whose conscience
fears it.</p>

<p>Never in her life had she needed such courage as to
turn up that gloomy and dismal street and accost the
forbidding threshold of S. Gedge Antiques. The shop
was still open, for it was hardly more than six o’clock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
and two gas jets lit the interior in a way that added to
its dolour.</p>

<p>She stood a moment with the knob of the shop door
in her hand. All the nerve she could muster was wanted
to venture within. But she did go in, and she felt a
keen relief when a hasty glance told her that Uncle
Si was not there.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXIII">XXXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> had a further moment of indecision while she
thought out what her line must be. She resolved to
go direct to her room and pack her box. Afterwards
she must find William and enlist his help in bringing
it downstairs, and then she would get a taxi and drive
off with her things before Uncle Si discovered his
loss. Otherwise...!</p>

<p>Her mind had not time to shape the grisly alternative,
before the immediate course of events shaped it for
her. Suddenly she was aware of a presence lurking in
the dark shadows of the shop interior. It was couchant,
vengeful, hostile. Almost before June could guess
what was happening it had sprung upon her.</p>

<p>With astounding force her right wrist was grasped
and twisted behind her back. She gave a little yelp of
pain. A second yelp followed, as she struggled to free
herself, only to find that she was locked in a vice, and
that to fight against it would be agony.</p>

<p>“Now, where is it?” The low voice hissing in her
ear was surely that of a maniac. “Where’s the picture?”
The grip upon her had the strength of ten.
“Where is it&mdash;eh?” As the question was put, her captor
shook her fiercely. “Tell me.” He shook her again.
“Oh, you won’t&mdash;won’t you?” And then she realized
that there was something in his hand.</p>

<p>She called wildly for William, but there was no
response.</p>

<p>“No use lifting up your voice. The boy’s out.”</p>

<p>She fought to get free, but with a wrist still locked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
she was at his mercy. “Now then, where’s that picture?
Won’t tell me&mdash;eh?” There was madness in
that depth of rage.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly there came a sickening crash upon
her shoulders. She let out with her heels and found
the shin of the enemy, she fought and screamed, yet
pinned like that, she felt her wrist must break and her
arm be wrenched from its socket.</p>

<p>“Where is it&mdash;you thief?” The stick crashed again,
this time in a series of horrible blows. So severe was
the pain that it seemed to drive through her whole
being. She began to fear that he meant to kill her; and
as the stick continued to descend she felt sure that he
would.</p>

<p>She was a strong, determined girl, but her captor
had her at a hopeless disadvantage. His strength, besides,
was that of one possessed. Her cries and struggles
merely added to his savagery.</p>

<p>“Tell me where it is or I’ll knock the life out of you.”</p>

<p>Utterly desperate, she contrived at last to break
away; and though with the force of a maniac he tried
to prevent her escape, somehow she managed to get
into the street. He followed her as far as the shop door,
brandishing the stick, hurling imprecations upon
her, and threatening what he would do if she didn’t
bring the picture back at once.</p>

<p>Bruised and gasping, June reeled into the darkness.
Feeling more dead than alive, she lingered nearby after
the old man had gone in, trying to pull her battered self
together. She badly wanted her box, yet the only hope
of getting it now was by means of the police. As
things were, however, it would not be wise to ask their
help. The old wretch was so clever he might be able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
to make her out a thief; besides, for the time being she
had had more than enough of this horrible affair.</p>

<p>Cruelly hurt she moved at last with slow pain
towards the Strand. By now she had decided that
her most imperative need was a night’s lodging. Before
starting to look for one, however, the enticing doors of
a teashop gave her a renewed sense of weakness.
Gratefully she went in and sat down, ordering a pot
of tea and a little bread and butter which she felt too
ill to eat.</p>

<p>Nearly half an hour she sat in the company of her
thoughts. Hard, unhappy thoughts they were. Without
one friend to whom in this crisis she could turn,
the world which confronted her now was an abyss.
The feeling of loneliness was desolating, yet, after
all, far less so than it would have been were she not
fortified by the memory of a certain slip of paper in
her purse.</p>

<p>A slow return of fighting power revived a spark of
natural resolution within her. After all, a potent
weapon was in her hands. She must think out a careful
plan of turning it to full account. And at the
worst she was now beyond the reach of Uncle Si.
Even if he kept her box and all its contents, weighed
in the scale of the picture’s fabulous worth, her modest
possessions amounted to very little.</p>

<p>Stimulated by this conclusion, she began to forget
her aches. When a waitress came June asked for her
bill. It was sixpence. She put her hand in the pocket
of her coat. Her purse was not there.</p>

<p>With a little thrill of fear, she felt in the pocket on
the other side. The purse was not there either. She
was stunned. This was a blow far worse than those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
she had just received. She grew so dazed that as
she got up she swayed against the table, and had to
hold on by it to save herself from falling.</p>

<p>The waitress who had written out the bill caught a
glimpse of scared eyes set in a face of chalk.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you well?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ve lost my purse,” June stammered. “It’s
fallen out of my pocket, I think.” As with frantic
futility she plunged her hand in again, she was raked
by the true meaning of such a fact in all its horror.
Unless her purse had been stolen on the Underground,
and it was not very likely, it had almost certainly fallen
out of her pocket in the course of the struggle with
Uncle Si.</p>

<p>It was lying now on the shop floor unless the old
wretch had found it already. And if he had he would
lose no time in examining its contents. He had only
to do so for the cloak-room ticket to tell him where
the Van Roon was deposited, and to provide him with
a sure means of obtaining it.</p>

<p>“You may have had your pocket picked.”</p>

<p>June did not think so. Yet, being unable to take
the girl into her confidence, she did not choose to disclose
her doubts.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have,” she gasped. And then face to
face with the extreme peril of the case, her overdriven
nerves broke out in mutiny. She burst into tears. “I
don’t know what I’ll do,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>The waitress was full of sympathy. “Your bill is
only sixpence. Come in and pay to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Through her tears June thanked her.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t my bill, although it’s very kind of you.
There was something very important in my purse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Where did you have it last?”</p>

<p>“In the booking hall, when I took a ticket from
Victoria to Charing Cross.”</p>

<p>“Your pocket’s been picked,” said the waitress with
conviction. “There’s a warning in all the Tubes.”</p>

<p>The comfort was cold, yet comfort it was of a kind.
June saw a wan ray of hope. After all, there was a
bare possibility that inexorable Fate was not the thief.</p>

<p>“I’d go to Scotland Yard if I were you,” said the
waitress. “The police often get back stolen property.
Last year my sister’s house was burgled, and they
recovered nearly everything for her.”</p>

<p>June began to pull herself together. It was not
hope, however, that braced her faculties, but an effort
of will. Hope there was none of recovering the purse,
but she was now faced by the stern necessity of getting
back the picture. In the light of this tragedy it was
in most serious peril. Delay might be fatal, if indeed
it had not already proved to be so. She must go at
once and get possession of the treasure lest it be too
late.</p>

<p>The waitress was a good Samaritan. Not only could
the bill wait until the next day, but she went even
further: “Is your home far from here?” she asked.</p>

<p>“My home&mdash;far?” said June, dazedly. For the
moment she did not understand all that was implied
by the question.</p>

<p>“If you live on the District, and you haven’t a season,
I don’t mind lending you a shilling to get you
home.”</p>

<p>June accepted a shilling with earnest thanks. In
the circumstances, it might be worth untold gold:
“You can give it me back any time you are passing,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
said the waitress, as June thanked her again and made
her way unsteadily out into the street.</p>

<p>The chill air of the Strand revived her a little. She
had decided already that she must go at once to Victoria.
Every minute would count, and it now occurred
to her that if she took the Underground, several might
be saved.</p>

<p>To the Underground in Trafalgar Square she went.
It was the hour of the evening rush. Queues were
lining up at all the booking office windows. And at
the first window she came to, some three persons or so
ahead of her, was a figure oddly familiar, which, however,
in her present state of disintegration she did not
recognize at once. It was clad in a sombre tail coat
of prehistoric design, jemima boots, frayed shepherd’s
plaid trousers braced high and a hard square felt hat
which gave a crowning touch of oppressive respectability.
Moreover, its progress was assisted by a heavy
knotted walking stick, at the sight of which June gave
an involuntary shiver.</p>

<p>An instant later the shiver had developed into a
long and paralyzing shudder. Uncle Si was just ahead
of her; in fact she was near enough to hear a harsh
voice demand almost with menace a ticket to Victoria.</p>

<p>June’s worst fears were realized. The purse had
fallen from her pocket to the shop floor in the struggle;
the old wretch had found it, deciphered the precious
ticket, put two and two together, and was now on his
way to claim the parcel. All this was crystal clear to
her swift mind. She felt a strong desire to faint, but
she fought her weakness. She must go on. Everything
was as good as lost&mdash;but she must go on.</p>

<p>She took her ticket. And then in the long subway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
to the platform she raced on ahead of Uncle Si. He
was so near-sighted that even had he been less absorbed
in his own affairs he would not have been likely to
notice her.</p>

<p>June reached the platform well in front of the old
man. But the train to Victoria was not in. It arrived
two minutes later; by then, Uncle Si had appeared,
and they boarded it together. She was careful, however,
not to enter the same compartment as the enemy.</p>

<p>Short as the journey was, June had ample time to
appreciate that the odds were heavily against her. The
mere fact that the cloak-room receipt for the parcel
was in the custody of Uncle Si would confer possession
upon him; it had only to be presented for the Van
Roon to be handed over without a question.</p>

<p>The one chance she had now was to get on well
ahead of the old beast, and convince the clerk that in
spite of the absence of the ticket the parcel was hers.
She knew, however, only too well that the hope of
being able to do this was frail indeed&mdash;at all events
before the holder of the ticket arrived on the scene to
claim it.</p>

<p>At Victoria, June dashed out of the train even before
it stopped. Running past the ticket collector at the
barrier and along the subway she reached the escalator
yards in front of Uncle Si, and, in spite of being unused
to this trap for the unwary, for Blackhampton’s more
primitive civilization knew escalators not, she ascended
to the street at a pace far beyond the powers of the
Old Crocodile. By this means, indeed, she counted on
gaining an advantage of several minutes, since it was
hardly likely that Uncle Si would trust himself to such
a contrivance, and in ignorance of the fact that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
just ahead, would choose the dignified safety of the
lift.</p>

<p>So far as it went the thought was reassuring. Alas,
it did not go far. As June ran through the long station
to the cloak-room at its farthest end, she had but a very
slender hope of being able to recover the parcel. She
had no intention, however, of submitting tamely to fate.
In this predicament, whatever the cost, she must make
one last and final effort to get back her treasure.</p>

<p>At the cloak-room counter she took her courage in
both hands. A man sour and elderly had replaced the
wearer of the green corduroy, who was nowhere to be
seen. This was a piece of bad luck, for she had hoped
that the nice-looking young man might remember her.
Happily, no other passengers besieged the counter at
the moment, so that without loss of time June was able
to describe the parcel and to announce the fact that
the ticket she had received for it was missing.</p>

<p>Exactly as she had foreseen the clerk raised an objection.
Without a ticket she couldn’t have the parcel.
“But I simply must have it,” said June. And spurred
by the knowledge that there was not one moment to
lose in arguing the case, she boldly lifted the flap of
the counter and entered the cloak-room itself.</p>

<p>“No use coming in here,” said the Clerk, crustily.
“You can’t take nothing away without a ticket.”</p>

<p>“But my purse has been stolen, I tell you,” said June.</p>

<p>“Then I should advise you to go and see the station-master.”</p>

<p>“I can’t wait to do that.” And with the defiance
of despair, expecting each moment to hear the voice
of Uncle Si at her back, June ignored the Clerk, and
proceeded to gaze up and down the numerous and
heavily burdened luggage racks for her property.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“N</span>ot</span> a bit o’ use, don’t I tell you.” The Clerk
was growing angry.</p>

<p>June pretended not to hear. Her heart beating fast
she went on with her search for the parcel; yet in the
midst of it she grew aware that somebody was approaching
the counter. She dare not pause to look who
it was, for she knew only too well that it was almost
bound to be Uncle Si.</p>

<p>The Clerk uttered another snarl of protest as he
turned away to attend to the new comer. As he did
so, June breathed a prayer that her eye might fall on
the parcel in that instant, for her only hope now was
to seize it and fly. That, however, was not to be. She
had omitted to notice the place in which it had been
put, and do as she would she could not find it now.</p>

<p>At this crucial moment, there emerged from the
inner office her friend of the green corduroy. She
simply leapt at what was now her one remaining chance.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you’ve come,” cried June, in a
voice that was a little frantic: “You remember my
bringing a brown paper parcel here, don’t you&mdash;about
two hours ago?”</p>

<p>The tone, tinged as it was with hysteria, caused
Green Corduroy to look at June with mild astonishment.
“I’ve lost the ticket you gave me for it, but I’m
sure you remember my bringing it.” Her brain seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
on fire. “Don’t you remember my giving you a ten
shilling note? And you had to go and get the change.”</p>

<p>Green Corduroy was a slow-brained youth, but a
knitting of the brow seemed to induce a hazy recollection
of the incident. But while the process was going
on, June gave a glance over her shoulder, and behold
there was Uncle Si the other side of the counter. A
second glance told her, moreover, that Crusty Sides
already had the fatal ticket in his hand.</p>

<p>What must she do? It was not a moment for half
measures. While she was stirring the memory of
Green Corduroy, the treasure would be gone. She did
not hesitate. Observing Crusty Sides wheel, paper in
hand, with the slow austerity of one of the Company’s
oldest and most respected servants towards a luggage
rack near by, June seized the clue. Of a sudden her
eyes lit on the parcel at the top of the pile. Already
the responsible fingers of Crusty Sides were straying
upwards, yet before they could enclose the Van Roon,
June made a dash for it, and managed to whisk it away
from under his nose.</p>

<p>Her brain was like quicksilver now. She had a mad
impulse to rush off with the treasure without further
explanation; all the same she was able to resist it, for
she realized that such a course would be too full of
peril.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;this is it,” she said in an urgent whisper to
Green Corduroy. And as she spoke, with a presence of
mind, which in the circumstances was a little uncanny,
she slipped behind a large pile of boxes out of view of
Uncle Si.</p>

<p>“Surely you remember my bringing it?”</p>

<p>Green Corduroy seemed to think that he did remember.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
At this point Crusty Sides, with an air of outrage,
sternly interposed. “But a pawty claims it. And here’s
his ticket.”</p>

<p>“The ticket’s mine,” said June, in a fierce whisper.
“It’s been taken from my purse.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ to do with us, that ain’t,” said Crusty Sides.</p>

<p>“But you <i>do</i> remember my bringing it, don’t you?”
Beseechingly June turned to Green Corduroy. And he,
that nice-looking young man, with a frown of ever-deepening
perplexity, slowly affirmed that he thought
he did remember.</p>

<p>“The ticket’s what we’ve got to go by,” said Crusty
Sides, sternly. “Nothin’ else matters to us.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll look at it,” said June to Green Corduroy,
“you’ll see that it’s made out in your writing.”</p>

<p>Green Corduroy looked and saw that it was. As
far as he was concerned, that seemed to clinch the
argument. And even Crusty Sides, a born bureaucrat,
was rather impressed by it. “You say this here ticket’s
been taken off on you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said June in an excited whisper. “By my
wicked thief of an uncle.”</p>

<p>Instantly she regretted the imprudence of her words.</p>

<p>“Uncle a thief, eh?” proclaimed Crusty Sides, in
a voice of such carrying power that to June it seemed
that the Old Crocodile could hardly fail to hear him.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, this gentleman knows that it was I who
brought the parcel,” she said, determinedly to Green
Corduroy.</p>

<p>That young man looked her straight in the eye, and
then declared that he did know. Further, like many
minds “slow in the uptake,” when once in motion they
are prone to deep conclusions. “Seems to me, Nobby,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
he weightily affirmed, under the stimulus no doubt of
being addressed as a gentleman, in the Company’s time,
by such a good-looking girl, “that as this lady has got
the parcel, and we have got the ticket for it, she and
Uncle had better fight it out between ’em.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” growled Nobby.</p>

<p>Green Corduroy, however, stimulated by the fiery
anguish of June’s glance, and no doubt still in thrall
to the fact that she considered him a gentleman, was not
to be moved from the statesmanlike attitude he had
taken up. “You let ’em fight it out, Nobby. This lady
was the one as brought it here.”</p>

<p>“I gave you a ten shilling note, didn’t I?” The voice
of June was as honeyed as the state of her feelings
would permit.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I fetched the change for you, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>Crusty Sides shook a head of confirmed misogyny.
“Very irregular, that’s all I’ve got to say about it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it is, Nobby. But it’s nothing to do with
you and me.”</p>

<p>Green Corduroy, with almost the air of a knight
errant, took the all-important slip of paper from his
colleague. Flaunting it in gallant fingers, he moved
up slowly to the counter.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques, buying spectacles on nose,
knotted cudgel in hand, was impatiently waiting. “The
parcel is claimed by the lady who brought it,” June
heard Green Corduroy announce.</p>

<p>She waited for no more. Following close behind
Crusty Sides, who also moved up to the counter, she
slipped quietly through an adjacent door to the main
line platform before Uncle Si grew fully alive to the
situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Clasping the parcel to her bosom, she glided swiftly
down the platform, and out by the booking hall, travelling
as fast as her legs would take her, without breaking
into a run, which would have looked like guilt, and
might have attracted public notice. She did not dare to
glance back, for she was possessed by a fear that the
old man and his stick were at her heels.</p>

<p>Once clear of the station itself, she yielded to the
need of putting as much distance between Uncle Si and
herself as a start so short would permit. There was
now hope of throwing him off the track. Thus, as
soon as she reached the Victoria Street corner, she
scrambled on to a bus that was in the act of moving
away.</p>

<p>One seat only was vacant and, as in a state of imminent
collapse she sank down upon it, she ventured for
the first time to look behind her. She quite expected to
find Uncle Si at her elbow already, but with a gasp of
relief she learned that the old man was nowhere in
sight.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> did not know in which direction the bus was
going. And when the conductor came for her
fare, which he did as soon as the vehicle began to move,
she was quite at a loss for a destination. There was
nothing for it but to draw a bow at a venture. She
asked for Oxford Circus, the only nodal point of the
metropolis, besides Charing Cross, with which she was
familiar. By a rare piece of luck, Oxford Circus was
included in its route, and what remained of the shilling
the girl at the teashop had given her was sufficient to
get her there, and leave four pence in hand.</p>

<p>Alighting at Oxford Circus, she stood under a lamp
to consider what she should do now. There was nowhere
she could go, there was not one friend to whom
she could turn. Battered and spent in body and spirit
by all that had happened to her during the last few
hours she was now in a flux of terror to which she
dare not yield.</p>

<p>At first she thought of seeking advice of a policeman,
but it would have been extremely difficult just then to
tell her strange story. Its complications were many
and fantastic; besides, and she trembled at the idea, it
was by no means clear that she would be able to establish
her claim to the Van Roon in the eye of the law.</p>

<p>Still, something would have to be done. She must
find a home of some kind not only for her treasure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
but for herself. Feeling desperately in need of help,
she decided as a preliminary measure to spend three
of her four remaining pence on a cup of tea. She had
a vague hope that in that magic beverage inspiration
might lurk.</p>

<p>The hope, as it chanced, was not vain. Near by was
an A.B.C. shop; and she had hardly sat down at one
of its marble-topped tables when, by an association of
ideas, her mysterious acquaintance, Mr. Adolph Keller,
sprang again into her mind. He had given her his
address. Alas, the slip of paper on which it was written
was in her purse, but she had a particularly good memory,
and by raking it fiercely she was able to recall the
fact that his place of domicile was Haliburton Studios,
Manning Square.</p>

<p>She did not like trusting any man on an acquaintance
so slight, especially as it had come about in so odd a
fashion, but Mr. Keller had shown himself very
friendly, and there was no one else to whom she could
turn. Sipping her cup of tea, in slow and grateful
weariness, she began to develop this idea. Horse sense,
Mr. Boultby had always said, was her long suit; therefore
she well understood the peril of taking a comparative
stranger into her confidence. But very cogently
she put to herself the question: What else could she do?</p>

<p>Of sundry policemen, who were very obliging, June
asked the way to Manning Square. It was in Soho, not
so very far from Oxford Circus, as she remembered
Mr. Keller saying, and, in spite of a local fog which
had come on in the last twenty minutes, the police were
so helpful that she had no great difficulty in getting
there. During the short journey her mind was much
engaged in settling just what she would and would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
say to Mr. Keller. She decided that as far as might
be practicable she would leave the picture out of the
case. It might not be possible to exclude it, but at any
rate she would begin by offering to sit to him as a
model, in accordance with his suggestion; and with that
the pretext of her visit she would see if she could get
him to lend her a little money to tide over immediate
needs.</p>

<p>By the time she had come to Manning Square it was
a few minutes past seven. Two complete circuits had
to be made of this dingy, ill-smelling gap in the heart
of Soho, before she came upon Haliburton Studios,
which were not in the Square itself, but in a dismal
by-street debouching from it. The tall block of buildings
which comprised the studios was equally dismal,
and as June entered a vestibule that shewed no light,
she felt a sudden chill strike at her heart.</p>

<p>This, however, was not a moment to quail. It was a
case, if ever there was one, of any port in a storm.
The hazard of her errand fell upon her like a pall, but
the knowledge that she had only a penny left with which
to obtain a night’s lodging was a veritable barb in the
flesh.</p>

<p>Try as she would she could not recall the number
of Mr. Keller’s studio; nor was the information to be
found upon the walls of the vestibule which she was
not able to see. But while she stood at the foot of a
winding flight of stone steps, striving to meet the difficulty
which faced her now, she heard someone coming
down. At the sound she went back to the door by
which she had entered, where a lamp contending feebly
against the fog, would enable her to see anyone who
passed out of the flats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>The person who did so proved to be one of June’s
own sex, a youngish woman whose fur coat seemed to
accentuate a note of tawdry and flamboyant finery.
Even in the semi-darkness June could see that her face
was rouged.</p>

<p>She had no illusion as to the kind of person she
addressed:</p>

<p>“You want Mr. Keller’s studio?” The woman
peered into June’s face in a manner which she felt to
be decidedly objectionable. “It’s the second door on
the first landing.” The tone, offhand, and more than a
little contemptuous, was like a blow in the face.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXVI">XXXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was not until the woman had passed out of the
vestibule into the street that June could find courage
to mount the stone stairs.</p>

<p>The knocker on the second door was so crazy that
it threatened to break off in her hand. Tact and skill
were called for to draw sound from it at all; bell there
was none; but a faint light percolated through the fanlight
and it was a glimpse of this which heartened June
to persevere. By dint of application she was able to
coax a few sounds out of the knocker, a feat which
at last brought reward. The beam beyond the fanlight
expanded; there was a shuffle of approaching slippers;
and then the door came open.</p>

<p>Mr. Keller, wearing a dressing gown in lieu of a
coat, stood before her.</p>

<p>“Hulloa!” he said.</p>

<p>Before June could find words of her own she had
been recognized: “Why&mdash;it’s you!” The gentlemanly
voice sounded most agreeable. “Walk right in. You’re
welcome as the flowers in May.”</p>

<p>Tossed by the tempest as Mr. Keller’s visitor still
was, she could not help contrasting such a welcome with
the air and manner of Uncle Si.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXVII">XXXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> geniality of Adolph Keller had a tonic effect
upon June’s depression. She crossed his threshold
with a sense of extreme relief, as one who finds a
refuge from the storm. He closed the door of the
flat, and then led the way into a spacious room with a
high ceiling which was fixed up as a studio.</p>

<p>It was not without an air of comfort. The main part
had been screened off; within a small but seductive
inner space a bright fire mingled pleasant gleams with
the radiance of the electric lamp. Two low wicker
chairs were set invitingly near the hearth, and a table
piled with books and magazines was between them.
Amid these, however, space had been found for a
tobacco jar, a siphon, a glass and a bottle of whisky.
On the floor was a French novel, which he had laid
down open to let her in.</p>

<p>Mr. Keller, evidently, was making himself comfortable
for the night. The contrast between this snug
and cheerful room and the rising fog, from which
June had just escaped, struck her at once as delightful.
With a little sigh of gratitude, she sank at the cordial
invitation of her host into the first of the easy chairs.</p>

<p>He remembered her quite well, of course, yet for
the moment he had forgotten her name, and what to
June was the more surprising, the appointment she had
made with him for that very afternoon seemed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
passed right out of his mind. Yet she was quick to
see, for her wits were now working at high pressure,
that this strange forgetfulness was in her favour. At
any rate, it was going to help her in the task of keeping,
as far as possible, the Van Roon out of the case.</p>

<p>“Lyons’, wasn’t it, we met at? One day last week?
Your name’s&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I’m Miss Gedge.” June’s tone was a shade “stand
off,” for that appeared to be correct in the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Miss Gedge&mdash;yes&mdash;of course. Stupid of me to
forget.” He fixed the eye of a man with a sense of
humour upon this odd visitor. “I’ve a shocking memory
for names. Very glad to see you, anyhow, Miss
Gedge.” He took the low chair opposite with the
calm and easy air of a model host. “And very nice
of you to come on a damp and foggy night.”</p>

<p>The tone, rather than the words, put it up to June
to explain her coming. She did so rather awkwardly,
with a touch of “nerves.” Yet before committing herself
to any positive statement as to why she was there,
she was careful to dispose the parcel she carried as far
beyond the range of his eyes as was possible at the side
of the wicker chair in which she sat.</p>

<p>“You told me the other day”&mdash;She found it impossible
to control the queer little tremble in her voice&mdash;“that
you wanted an artist’s model, and that my hair
was just the colour you were looking for.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, yes,” he laughed. “Your hair’s topping.”
The laugh deepened to enthusiasm. “It’s the colour I
want, to a hayseed.” An eye of veiled appraisement
passed slowly over her. “And what’s almost as important
there’s stooks of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” said June, doing her best to pick up
his light tone of intimacy. “It is important, I suppose,
for an artist’s model to have hair long and thick.”</p>

<p>“Ra-ther!” As he looked at her sideways, out of
the corner of one eye, his tone seemed to change a
little; and then he got up alertly from his chair, the
mantle of the model host again upon him. “I’m afraid
there’s not much to offer you in the way of refreshment.
There’s only whisky. If you’ll excuse me a minute,
I’ll fetch another glass.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, please, not for me,” said June quickly. She
was very tired and horribly depressed, but she had been
strictly brought up.</p>

<p>The host seemed a little amused by her vehemence.
He looked at her keenly with a pair of curious, small,
near-set eyes, which June liked even less now than when
she had noticed them first. “Well, have a cigarette,
anyhow. These are like mother’s milk.” And he
offered a box of Virginia.</p>

<p>June also declined a cigarette, in the same odd,
rather fluttered tone which caused him to smile in a
way that added to her nervousness.</p>

<p>“No? Well, make yourself comfy, anyhow. Draw
your chair up to the fire.”</p>

<p>She thanked him in a voice which, in spite of itself
was a little prim, and which assured him that she was
quite warm enough where she was. The attempted
lightness and ease had gone; a subtle sense of fear, bred
of hidden danger yet without any root in fact or logic,
was rising in her. The position itself was embarrassing,
yet so far Mr. Keller had shown no wish to presume
upon it. Up till now he had been easy and
charming; but June, in spite of worldly inexperience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
had the intuitions of her sex to guide her; and she felt
instinctively that there might be a great deal behind
these graces. She was grateful all the same; they were
much needed balm for many bruises.</p>

<p>When Mr. Keller sat down again in the wicker chair,
about two yards away from her, a sense of languor
crept upon June. The warmth of the fire, the glow of
the lamp, the notes of a singularly quiet voice were like
a subtle drug. Alive to danger as she was, its caress
was hard to resist. Such a position was one of acute
peril, for she was literally throwing herself upon the
mercy of a person who was very much an unknown
quantity, yet what alternative was there?</p>

<p>“Don’t mind a pipe, I hope?” The polite voice from
the chair opposite was not really ironical; it was merely
kind and friendly, yet feminine intuition shivering
upon the dark threshold of a mighty adventure knew
well enough how easily a tone of that kind could turn to
something else.</p>

<p>“Oh no, I don’t mind at all.” She tried again to get
the right key, but a laugh she could not control, high-pitched
and irrelevant, was horribly betraying.</p>

<p>“That’s all right then.”</p>

<p>For about a minute, Mr. Keller puffed away in a
sort of whimsical silence. Then he said with a soft
fall, whose mere sweetness had the power to alarm,
“Your hair’s jolly. Very jolly indeed!”</p>

<p>June nervously muttered that she was very glad he
liked it.</p>

<p>“So much of it, don’t you know. Awfully useful
to me just now. Quantity’s almost as valuable as the
colour. Does it reach your waist when you let it
down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>June, not without a little pride, said that her hair
when let down reached below her waist.</p>

<p>“Capital!” said Mr. Keller, with a laugh. “The
very thing I’m looking for just now. You’ll make a
stunning Andromeda.”</p>

<p>June had not heard of Andromeda. She had read
some Dickens, and a little George Eliot, and she could
remember bits of Shakespeare learned at school, but her
tastes were not literary. She pretended to know all about
Andromeda, yet the next words of Mr. Keller were
a proof that he was not deceived. June did not
know, however, that he had pierced clean through
her ignorance.</p>

<p>“She’s the altogether. A classical subject.”</p>

<p>“I like classical subjects myself.” Abruptly June’s
mind went back to Miss Preece, the revered head mistress
of the Blackhampton High School where it had
been her privilege to spend one term. Her voice rose
a whole octave, in its involuntary desire to approximate
as closely as possible to that of a real lady.</p>

<p>“So do I.” Mr. Keller’s humorous purr was that
of a man well pleased. “That’s capital.”</p>

<p>“You can’t beat classical subjects, can you?” said
June, making a wild attempt to achieve the conversational.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Keller looked across at her out of those
near-set eyes of which by now she was rather afraid.
“No, you can’t,” he said. “So large and so simple, and
yet they strike so deep. They are life itself. A sort of
summing up, don’t you know, of all that has been, all
that can be, all that will be.”</p>

<p>June responded with more composure than she had
yet shewn that she supposed it was so. It was nice to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
listen to talk of this kind from a man of Mr. Keller’s
polish. The chair was most comfortable, and how good
it was to be in front of the bright fire! Her nerves
were being lulled more and more as if by a drug; the
sense of her peril amid this sea of danger into which
she had plunged began to grow less.</p>

<p>“I expect,” said Mr. Keller, in a tone so friendly
and so casual that it fed the new sense of peace which
was now upon June, “I expect you are pretty well used
to the altogether?”</p>

<p>Even if she did not know in the least what was meant
by “the altogether,” it did not seem to be quite wise to
confess such ignorance. “Ye-es, I suppose I am.”
And in a weak attempt to rise to his own agreeable
plane of intimacy she laughed rather foolishly.</p>

<p>“Capital!” said Adolph Keller. “You are a well
built girl.” He sipped a little whisky. “Excellent
shoulders. Figure’s full of fine lines. Bust well
developed. Plenty of heart room. Everything just
right.”</p>

<p>She coloured at the literal way in which he catalogued
her points; even if it was done in the manner
of an artist and a gentleman, one was a little reminded
of a dog or a horse.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you up a screen. And then you can get
ready.” He sipped a little more whisky, and rose
briskly and cheerfully. “Near the fire; it’s real chillsome
to-night. And when you pose you can sit on top
of it if you like.” He opened the lid of the coal box,
and replenished the fire. “We must take care you don’t
catch cold. If you feel a draught, you can have a rug
round your knees. I only want to make a rough sketch
of the lines of the figure, to begin with; the shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
chiefly. It won’t take long. Quite sure you won’t have
a finger?” He pointed to the whisky. “Buck you up
a bit. You look rather down.”</p>

<p>June was quite sure that she would not have a finger.
Mr. Keller passed beyond the screen into the studio
itself to procure a second screen. June felt this activity
to be alarming. It brought her up against the fact
that she was there in the capacity of an artist’s model.
Suddenly it dawned upon her that she was expected to
take off her clothes.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>r. Keller</span> cleared a space near the fire, and
elaborately arranged a second screen, which
June did not fail to notice was decorated with nude
figures.</p>

<p>“There you are,” he said. “That’ll keep you snug.
And if you sit on a stool by the fire with a rug over
your knees, you’ll be as warm as a kitten.”</p>

<p>June paled, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>“Begin as soon as you like, the sooner the better.
Are you quite sure you won’t have just a spot?” Again
he pointed to the bottle on the table. “You look as if
you want a drop of something.”</p>

<p>Once more June declined the offer in a voice which
in her own ear seemed absurdly small and faint.</p>

<p>“Pity,” said Mr. Keller cheerfully, as he looked at
her. “It’d put some life in you.” And then, as she
was still inert, he went on in a tone which pleasantly
mingled gentlemanliness and business, “I always pay
a sovereign an hour, you know&mdash;for the altogether.”</p>

<p>A light of fear came into June’s large eyes. “Does
it mean,” she asked, shyly and awkwardly, as she
looked away from him, “that I shall have to take off
my clothes?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” he said, matter-of-factly. Her
obvious embarrassment was not lost upon him, but the
knowledge did not appear in his manner.</p>

<p>June shivered slightly. In that shiver a deep instinct
spoke for her. “I couldn’t do that,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?” He lit a cigarette. “Aren’t you
well?”</p>

<p>June was very far from well. She felt within an
ace of being overcome by all that had happened to her.
Besides her bruised shoulders were still aching horribly.
Even without the deep instinct that governed her, it
would not have been possible to expose them.</p>

<p>“No-no,” she said, “I&mdash;I’m not well.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, she had to fight a powerful desire to
burst into tears. But her latent fear of this man had
suddenly grown. Overdriven as she was, however,
she was yet conscious of a stern need to keep a hold
upon herself. She knew nothing, less than nothing of
her host, beyond the fact that he was smooth of speech.
On the surface he was a gentleman, but as he stood
looking down at her now she glimpsed in his dark eyes
that which seemed to countervail everything.</p>

<p>Again she shivered. The sense of helplessness was
paralyzing. It was as if a chasm had abruptly opened
right under her feet. She was at his mercy. But she
must not give one thought, so long as a spark of will
remained with her, to the possibility of throwing herself
upon it.</p>

<p>He continued to stand looking at her while she
fought against a welling weakness that must have been
only too patent. Then, as if a little puzzled by her, he
went and fetched a glass from another part of the
studio. He poured out a small quantity of spirit and
offered it neat.</p>

<p>“Drink this. It’ll do you good.”</p>

<p>His voice, for the first time, had the grip of authority.
He held the glass to her lips, but as if containing
deadly fumes they shrank from contact with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be a little fool.” The sharp tone was like
the touch of a whip. “Why don’t you do as you are
told?”</p>

<p>She had not the strength to resent the command
even if she was able to muster the power to resist it.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, confronted by a limit to patience.
“Why have you come? What’s the matter
with you? Tell me.”</p>

<p>She remained mute. There was nothing she could
tell. A lodging for the night, food, advice, protection
were what she sought. Dominated completely as she
was by hard necessity, she yet dare not confide in
Keller. The subtle change that had come upon him
since he had fixed up the screen and poured out the
whisky filled her with an intense longing to get away.
In spite of a growing weakness, which now threatened
dire collapse, the subtle feelers of her mind were on
the track of danger.</p>

<p>With a slow gathering of will that was a form of
agony, she tried to collect the force to rise from the
perilous comfort of the low wicker chair. But she was
not able to rouse herself to action before the effort had
been nipped by his next remark.</p>

<p>“If you’ve no intention of sitting to me, you’d better
say in two words why you’ve come here.”</p>

<p>The voice was no longer smooth; there was a cutting
edge to it, lacerating to June’s ear.</p>

<p>“I wanted you to lend me a sovereign.”</p>

<p>It was the literal truth. But the unguarded words
slipped from her before she could shape or control them.
Almost before they were uttered she realized their bitter
unwisdom.</p>

<p>“You can have a sovereign&mdash;if that’s all you want.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
His tone grew light again. “But it’s only fair and
reasonable that you should earn it first.”</p>

<p>Strive as she would, she was not able to keep a faint
dew of tears from filming her eyes.</p>

<p>“No need to take off more than your bodice, if that’s
what’s troubling you.”</p>

<p>With her shoulders on fire, she could not take off her
bodice, even had she wished to do so.</p>

<p>She sat inert while he continued to stand before her.
The thread of will she still had, fully concentrated
though it was on getting away from him, was now unequal
to the ugly challenge of his voice and eyes.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” she half whimpered.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in her own despite, her defences had
begun palpably to fail. The blunder was fatal&mdash;if the
cry of nature overdriven can be called a blunder. His
eyes pinned hers. Trembling under the spell of their
hard cunning she began to perceive that it was now a
case of the serpent and the bird.</p>

<p>A frown darkened his face as he cast back to the
first meeting with this girl. He tried to recall their
conversation in the teashop two days ago. At the
time it had interested him considerably, but he had
laughed over it since, and decided to dismiss it from
his mind. She had told him a cock-and-bull story about
a picture. He could not recall the details of an absurd
yarn which had not seemed worth his while to remember.
At the best it was a bald and unconvincing
narrative. But it concerned a Rembrandt. No, not a
Rembrandt. A Van Roon!</p>

<p>With a heightening of curiosity, Adolph Keller
gazed at the hunted creature now shrinking from his
eyes. By Jove, she looked as if she had been through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
it! Something pretty bad must have happened to her
quite recently. But why had she come to him?</p>

<p>Thoughts of the picture set his active mind to work.
She had come to him because she was in want of
money. So much, at least, was clear. To judge by
the look of her, she had probably, at a moment’s notice,
been turned out of house and home. A domestic
servant, no doubt, and no better than she should be,
although a certain taste about her much-rumpled clothes
and an attempt at refinement of manner suggested the
wish to rise above her class.</p>

<p>In the midst of this quick mind process, Adolph
Keller saw the brown paper parcel. It was in the place
where his visitor had laid it when she had first sat
down. He noticed that she had cunningly reared it
by the farther side of her chair, so that it might be
beyond the immediate range of his eye.</p>

<p>Keller’s pulse quickened, yet he allowed no hint of
his intriguing discovery to shew in his manner. Once
again it changed towards his guest. The tone of sharp
authority vanished. Twisting a dark moustache round
strong, yet delicate fingers, his air of extreme gentlemanliness
verged upon the sugary, as he said: “I don’t
like to see you like this. I don’t really.”</p>

<p>The tone’s unexpectedness, perhaps even more than
its kindness, moved June to further tears.</p>

<p>“You had better tell me, hadn’t you, just what’s
upset you?”</p>

<p>She shook miserably. And then, thrown off her
guard, by this new note of concern, she found the
courage to venture again: “Please lend me a sovereign
and let me go. I promise solemnly to pay it back.”</p>

<p>He smiled in a way obviously to reassure. “What’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
your hurry, my dear girl?” Soft, as were the words,
they yet caused the design to fail.</p>

<p>Their non-effect was clearly visible in the girl’s tragic
eyes. She was caught in a trap; all his trimmings and
posturings seemed only to emphasize the fact that she
had no means of getting out.</p>

<p>Like a powerful drug the brutal truth attacked her
brain. It was as if its higher nerve centres could no
longer act. She was completely in the power of this
man. And only too well did she know that he knew it.</p>

<p>Inevitably as fate, those slim fingers dipped towards
the side of her chair. “What have we here?” The
inflexion was lightly playful, yet it drove all the blood
from her heart. “May I look?” His hand closed on
the parcel before she could muster one futile finger to
stay it.</p>

<p>Galvanized, as if by electricity, she sprang up from
her chair without knowing what she did. “Please&mdash;it’s
mine!” Without conscious volition she tried weakly to
defend her property.</p>

<p>He put her off with the cheery playfulness of a teasing
brother. “Just one little peep,” he said. The treasure
was yielding its wrappings already to those deft
fingers. Smiling all the time, he treated the thing as
a mere joke. And he was able to give the joke full
effect, because, not for an instant did he expect it to
turn out anything else.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXIX">XXXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>dolph Keller</span> gave a low whistle. He took
in his breath quickly. The treasure, in its rare
incredible beauty, had declared itself to his eyes. And
to the eyes of an artist, wholly unready for the revelation,
it came in a single devastating flash.</p>

<p>“My God!” he said, in a whisper, half rapture, half
surprise.</p>

<p>Aglow with excitement he removed the shade from
the electric lamp. Holding the picture beneath the light,
an arm’s length away from his eyes, he turned it over
several times in that fashion of the expert which June
had now learned to dread. And then humming softly,
and with his fingers still enclosing it, he passed beyond
the screen to a table on which lay a microscope.</p>

<p>With a feeling of nausea, June watched everything
he did. Only too well she knew that the microscope
would simply feed his excitement. In a fresh spasm of
weakness, she reeled against the chimneypiece. She
had now the sensation of having fallen over a precipice
into a bottomless pit. Already she was sinking down,
down, down into night and damnation.</p>

<p>Keller soon returned, microscope in hand; and while
he plied it under the lamp she dare not glance at his
face. Passively she waited for his next words. The
power of action had left her.</p>

<p>When, at last, he did speak, his voice was calmer and
gentler than she looked for. “Tell me,” he said, “how
did you come by this rather jolly old thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>The tone of playfulness was almost silly. But she
was not deceived, for striking through it was the oiliness
of Uncle Si. And she knew that she had only to
glance at that face shining pale under the lamp, which
was a thing she dare not do, to carry the resemblance
farther.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he repeated softly.</p>

<p>A sense of destiny seemed to weigh her down.</p>

<p>“It has been given to me.” Her voice was hardly
audible.</p>

<p>“Given to you.” He smiled a little, as his mind
went off in search of the half forgotten fragments of
their talk two days ago. “Let me see&mdash;your best boy,
wasn’t it?&mdash;who made you a present of a picture&mdash;by
a well known R. A.?”</p>

<p>June did not know how to answer, yet she was able
to realize that an answer of some kind was imperative.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” she said. There was nothing else she
could say.</p>

<p>“I rather like this thing, do you know.” His voice
was acquiring a sort of growing brightness which
seemed quite to admit her to his confidence. “It might
almost have been painted by the snuffy old Scotsman&mdash;one
MacFarlane by name&mdash;who first shewed me how
to draw. It’s just in his manner. By Jove!”&mdash;The
voice of Adolph Keller seemed to glow with humour&mdash;“I
can almost see that cantankerous whiskyfied old fool
daubing that water and those trees. But in his day not
a bad painter, you know, not a bad painter.” And the
voice of the pupil tailed off in a note of reluctant affection
of which he seemed half ashamed.</p>

<p>It was June’s turn to say something, but her frozen
lips could not utter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>Keller, holding the picture in both hands, gave her
a side look, which he tried, as far as he could, to conceal.
In the midst of this scrutiny, he said: “To you,
I expect, one picture is very much the same as another?”</p>

<p>“I know what I like,” June was able to answer, perhaps
for no better reason than that by now she understood
only too well that it hardly mattered what she
answered.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, that’s something,” said Keller, with
a forced laugh. “Great thing to know your mind in
these little matters. Nice of your best boy&mdash;was your
best boy, wasn’t it?&mdash;to give you this. Not that it’s
worth much to the ordinary buyer. Pictures are like
lovers, you know. Their beauty, sometimes, is in the
eye of the beholder.”</p>

<p>It sickened her to hear him lie in this way. The
deadly sensation of falling, falling, falling came over
her again. But she let him run on. For one thing
she lacked the power to check him; and even had the
power been hers it would have been worse than futile
to try to do so.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“L</span>ook</span> here,” said Adolph Keller, in the midst
of his prattle. “I’ve taken rather a fancy to
this bit of a thing. Suppose you let me have it. I’ll give
you a landscape in exchange; I’ve one or two that
are not so bad, and you shall have your pick. Moreover,”
and he fixed June with a steady eye, “you shall
have your sovereign as well.”</p>

<p>She shook her head tensely. Inclination now wished
to tell him the fabulous worth of the picture; but prudence
said no. The calculated way in which he had
lied was proof enough that he knew its value already.
She held out her hand. In a voice dry and choking she
said: “Please give it to me. I ought to be going.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her with the eye of a condor. “Much
better take what you can get for it, hadn’t you? It’ll
be a difficult thing to sell, you know. This is quite
a fair offer.”</p>

<p>“Give it me, please,” June gasped miserably.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a little fool.”</p>

<p>The tone was like the closing of a door. She knew
at once that he had not the remotest intention of giving
it back to her. And what followed immediately upon
the words made the fact only too clear. He laid the
picture on a table some little distance away, and then
pouring out a quantity of spirit he drank it neat. His
next act was to produce a case from which he took
forth a pound note.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” he said roughly. “Take this and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
be jolly thankful. And then make yourself scarce, as
soon as you like.”</p>

<p>It was an intimation that there was going to be no
more pretence. The tone was that of a cynical bully
who judged it to be best for both parties that the owner
of the Van Roon should now be given an unmistakable
perception of reality.</p>

<p>Overdriven as June was, the knowledge that at the
very last she was to be robbed of the fruits of her hard-won
victory was more than she could bear. Faced by
this man’s cool insolence and mean cunning, she was
swept by a tide of rage. He knew that she could have
no proof of ownership, and he was going to reap a full
advantage from the fact. At that moment, of an unendurable
bitterness, she was spurred and lashed by the
same Devil which two hours ago had driven Uncle Si
to frenzy.</p>

<p>“The picture’s mine,” she cried hoarsely. And then,
advancing towards the table. “Give it me ... you
thief!”</p>

<p>At the ugly word he recoiled a step, but the next
instant he grabbed her by the wrists. In the struggle
to get free, she felt his evil breath upon her face.
Many a dram must have gone to so much foulness;
as his powerful grip slowly fastened upon her there
came swift knowledge of a new and more urgent peril.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She was alone with this man in his own flat. Utterly
without a means of defence as she was, she had been
mad enough to offer him a physical challenge. In a
few seconds she would be at his mercy. And then, inflamed
by drink, and being the kind of beast that he
was he would insist upon the spoils of the victor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>Before she was fully alive to what was taking place
she found herself forced slowly backwards to the wall.
She knew then that she was fighting for her life, and
for that which in this unspeakable moment implied so
much more.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you to come here, you&mdash;&mdash;!” His face was
that of a maniac.</p>

<p>She gave a shriek of terror and lashed out wildly at
his shins. Fighting like a tigress, at first she kept him
at bay. The power of his hands was terrific, but she
did not scruple to use the weapons nature had given
her. After a long and horrible minute of claws, teeth
and feet, in the course of which she bit him savagely,
it grew reasonably clear to Adolph Keller that if only
she cares to use it, the female of the species does not
lack a means of defence.</p>

<p>“You beauty!” he gasped, as he struggled to shift
his grip upon her.</p>

<p>Goaded by the furies he found his way at last to her
throat. And then she felt that he was going to kill her.
Moreover, as his madman’s grip began slowly to distil
her life through its fingers, he perceived how simple a
matter it was going to be.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">K</span>eller’s</span> own defences were almost down, but
just in the nick of time was he able to realize
this fact. And man of calculation that he was, even
in this moment of madness, when each devil in his soul
conspired for his final overthrow, he was able, by dint
of underlying coolness of blood to make a powerful
effort to save himself.</p>

<p>He longed to kill this wretched girl, but as he pressed
his fingers into the soft and delicate throat, he was
stayed by thoughts of the price that would have to be
paid for wreaking an insane passion upon her.</p>

<p>For a wild instant he feared that the premonition had
come too late; the primordial beast in his heart had
slipped its chain. Already it had tasted blood. In
this frenzy of revolt, the fetters imposed by centuries
of civil life were hardly likely to be submitted to again.</p>

<p>Gasping and helpless June felt that she was dying.
The clutch upon her was that of the garotte. Her
eyes began to darken. Clawing the air for the breath
she could not draw, the end that seemed inevitable
now was yet far off.</p>

<p>At last, as if responding to her prayer, a kind of
stupor came upon her. But how tardily! Brain, heart,
soul, body contended no more against a power beyond
their own; at last her slow life was ebbing. The end
of torment indescribable would be akin to joy.</p>

<p>Æons seemed to pass. A flicker of summer lightning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
ages off, came and was not. So faint it was and
so far that it could only be reckoned in terms of
eternity. More light flickered which, of a sudden, grew
miraculously near. The vivid sense of pain returned;
she grew alive to the fact that the harsh glare of the
electric bulb, which was still unshaded, was beating
down upon her eyes.</p>

<p>Powerful arms were about her, she was being supported.
The fumes of raw spirit were in her nostrils,
a glass was pressed against her lips. She fought again
to get free, only feebly now, for this was but a last
reaction of a dying will. Yet the final word of all
was nature’s. When mind itself had ceased to count,
the life-force grasped wildly at the proffered means of
life.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” she heard a thick voice mutter. “I
felt sure you were a goner.”</p>

<p>A livid face, whose eyes seemed to blind her own,
materialized suddenly before her. “Drink it up, damn
you!” said the voice hoarsely. “And then get out&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>It was insult for the sake of insult, and therefore
the full measure of her victory. But it meant less
than nothing to June now. She scarcely heard, or
hearing did not comprehend. Beyond pain and suffering,
beyond good and evil her torn spirit only craved
release.</p>

<p>As soon as the fire in the glass had kindled her veins
this desire was met, less, however, by the operation
of her own will than by the will of Keller. As if she
had been a noisome reptile whom his flesh abhorred,
and yet had a superstitious fear of killing, he dragged
her out of the room, along the short passage as far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
as the door of the flat. Slipping back the catch, he
flung her out on to the landing.</p>

<p>As she fetched up against the iron railing opposite
the door, which guarded the well of the staircase, she
heard a low hiss: “Take yourself off as soon as you
like, you&mdash;&mdash;, or you’ll find the police on your track.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> had no idea of the time that she lay in a huddle
against the railing. But it may not have been
so long in fact as it was in experience. Shattered she
might be, yet unknown to herself, there was still a
reserve of fighting power to draw upon.</p>

<p>Cold iron, moreover, and raw air had a magic of
their own. Clear of that mephitic room and the foul
presence of Keller, a fine human machine began slowly
to renew itself. Except for a faint gleam from
the room out of which she had just come, stealing
through the fanlight of the door out of which she had
been flung, there was not a sign of light upon the
staircase. The entire building appeared to be deserted.
Its stone-flagged steps were full of echoes as soon as
she ventured to move upon them; and when clinging
to the railing for support she had painfully descended
two she entered a region of total darkness.</p>

<p>It was like going down into a pit. Could she have
only been sure that death awaited her below, she might
have been tempted to fling herself into it headlong.
But she knew that the ground was not far off.</p>

<p>Three or four steps more brought her to the vestibule.
At the end of it was a door, open to the street.
Outside this door shone a faint lamp, round which
weird shadows circled in a ghostly witch-dance. The
night beyond was a wall of horrors, which she had lost
the will to face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Met by this pitiless alternative, she recoiled against
the wall of the vestibule, huddling in its darkest corner,
behind the stairs. Crouching here, like a hunted thing
at bay, she fought for the courage to go out and face
her destiny.</p>

<p>She fought in vain. Half collapsed as she now was,
a spur was needed to drive her into the grim wilderness
of the open street. One glance at the crypt outside
sufficed to tell her that with no point to make for, it
would be best to stay where she was and hope soon
to die.</p>

<p>Why had she not had the sense to throw herself
down the stairs and kill herself? A means would have
to be found before the night was out. She could bear
no more. A terrible reaction was upon her. It was
as if a private door in her mind had suddenly given
way and a school of awful phantoms had rushed in
and flooded it.</p>

<p>She was living in a nightmare that was too bad to
be true. But it was true and there lay its terror.
Adrift in the dark canyons of that vast city, penniless
and alone, with the marks of thieves and murderers
upon her bruised body, and her treasure stolen, there
was only one thing to look for now.</p>

<p>Death, however, would not be easy to come by. As
she huddled in cold darkness in the recess behind the
stairs she felt that her will was going. To enter the
night and make an end would need courage; but a
miserable clapping together of the jaws was sign
enough that the last hope of all was slipping away
from her.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">C</span>owering</span> in body and spirit in that dark corner,
time, for June, became of no account. Perhaps,
after all, she might be allowed to die where she
was. As a kind of inertia crept upon her she was able
to draw something of comfort from the thought. It
would be better than the river or being run over in the
street.</p>

<p>She grew very cold; yet a lowering of the body’s
temperature induced a heightened consciousness. Aches
and pains sprang into life; the forces of her mind began
to reassert themselves; the phantoms about her took
on new powers of menace. Gradually it became clear
to June, under the goad of this new and sharper phase
of suffering, that mere passivity could not induce the
death she longed for.</p>

<p>No, it was not in that way the end would come.
She would have to go into the shadow-land beyond the
lamp, and seek some positive means of destroying herself.
For that reason she must hold on to the fragment
of will that now remained to her. It alone could release
her from the awful pit in which she was now engulfed.</p>

<p>She gathered herself for an effort to move towards
the fog-encircled light at the entrance to the street.
But the effort, when made, amounted to nothing. Her
limbs were paper, all power of volition was gone.</p>

<p>The October raw struck to her blood. She began
to whimper miserably. To pain of mind was added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
pain of body, but the delicate apparatus from whose
harmony sprang the fuse of action was out of gear.
Something must be done; yet no matter how definite
the task, any form of doing was beyond her now.</p>

<p>At this dire moment, however, help came. It came,
moreover, in an unlooked-for way. She heard a door
slam over head. There was the sound of a match
being struck, and then came a gingerly shuffle of feet
on the stone stairs.</p>

<p>Someone was coming down. June cowered still
lower into the dark recess at the back of the stairway.
A man was approaching. And by the flicker of the
match which he threw away as he reached the floor of
the vestibule she saw that the man was Keller.</p>

<p>Faint and but momentary as was the glimpse afforded,
June, with every sense strung again to the point
of intensity, saw that under Keller’s arm was a brown
paper parcel. The sight of it was like a charm. Some
fabulous djinnee might have lurked in that neat package,
who commanded a miraculous power of reaction
upon the human will.</p>

<p>Keller struck a second match and peered into the
shadows. June knew that he was looking to see if she
had lingered there, but the light could not pierce to
the corner in which she crouched; and it burnt itself
out, leaving him none the wiser.</p>

<p>Without striking another match Keller moved away
from her towards the doorway, and as he did so June
felt a swift release of heart and brain. A thrill of
new energy ran through her. No sooner had Keller
passed out of the vestibule, beyond the lamp into the
fog, than without conscious impulse or design she began
to follow him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>It may have been the reasoned act of a lucid being,
but at first it did not appear to be so. Once, however,
her limbs were moving, all her faculties, now intensely
awake, seemed as if by magic to bear them company.
As soon as she reached the open street, with Keller a
clear ten yards ahead, the keen air on her face had an
effect of strong wine. Her nerves felt again the sense
of motion; the impulse of the natural fighter unfurled
strong pinions within her. All the virile sense and the
indomitable will of a sound inheritance rallied to her
need.</p>

<p>Growing sensibly stronger at every yard, she followed
Keller round the corner into Manning Square.
The mist was thick, the lamps poor and few, but as
well as she could she kept on his track. Lurking pantherlike
in the deep shadows of the house-walls, she
had approached within five yards of him by the time he
had turned the corner into a bye-street. He went a
few yards along this, and then zigzagged into a squalid
ill-smelling thoroughfare whose dismal length seemed
unending.</p>

<p>June had no difficulty in keeping up with these twists
and winds, for Keller, impeded by the fog, moved
slowly. For her, however, the fog had its own special
problem, since there was a danger of losing him if
he was allowed to get too far ahead; and yet if his
steps were dogged too closely there was always the
fear that he might turn round suddenly and see her.</p>

<p>At last the interminable street seemed to be nearing
its end. For June, whose every faculty was now strung
up to an unnatural acuteness, saw but a short distance
in front the brightly lit awning of the Underground
looming through the fog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>In a flash she realized the nature of the peril. Only
too surely was this the bourn for which Keller was
making. Once within its precincts and her last remaining
hope would be gone.</p>

<p>It must be now or never. The spur of occasion
drove deep in her heart. She knew but too well that
the hope was tragically small, but wholly desperate as
she was, with the penalty of failure simply not to be
met, she would put all to the touch.</p>

<p>Closer and closer she crept up behind the quarry.
But the entrance to the Tube loomed now so near that
it began to seem certain that she must lose him before
she could attempt what she had to do. Abruptly, however,
within ten yards or so of his goal, Keller stopped.
He began to search the pockets of his overcoat for a
box of matches to relight his pipe which had gone out.
While so doing, and in the preoccupation of the moment,
he took the parcel from under his right arm,
and set it rather carelessly beneath his left.</p>

<p>Providence had given June her chance. Like a
falcon, she swooped forward. Aim and timing incredibly
true, at the instant Keller struck a match and
bent over his pipe, her fingers closed on the Van Roon,
and whisked it out of his unguarded grasp.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> June turned and ran she heard a wild and
startled oath. Before her was the eternal fog-laden
darkness of the narrow street. But now it struck
her with a thrill of pure terror that the mist was not
thick enough to conceal her flight. The swift surprise
of the onset had gained for her a start of a few yards,
but instantly she knew that it would not suffice.</p>

<p>She ran, all the same, as if her heart would burst.
But her legs seemed to wear the shackles that afflict
one in a dream. Her most frantic efforts did not urge
them on, and yet, in spite of that, they bore her better
than she knew. Not a soul was in sight. She could
hear Keller’s boots echo on the damp pavement as they
pounded behind her. It could only be a matter of
seconds before his fingers were again on her throat.
But this time, before robbing her of the Van Roon
and getting clear, he would have to kill her.</p>

<p>The vow had hardly been made, when at the other
side of the street she saw a thread of light. It came
from a house whose door was open. Instinctively she
turned and made one final dash for it. This was the
last wild hope there was.</p>

<p>A man, it seemed, was in the act of leaving the house.
Wearing overcoat and hat, he stood just within the
doorway peering into the murk before venturing out.
June flung herself literally upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“Save me! Save me!” she was able to gasp. “A
man! A man is after me!”</p>

<p>The house was of the poverty-stricken kind whose
living room opens on to the street. June had a confused
vision of a glowing lamp, a bright fire, a dingy
tablecloth and several people seated around it. Her
wild impact upon the man who was about to put off
from its threshold drove him backwards several paces
into the room. At the same instant a female voice,
loud and imperious, rose from the table.</p>

<p>“Shut the door, Elbert, can’t yer? The fog’s comin’
in that thick it’ll put out the perishin’ fire.”</p>

<p>The bewildered Elbert, raked fore and aft by fierce
women, automatically obeyed the truculent voice at
his back, even while he gave ground in a collision which
seemed to rob him of any wit that he might possess.
With a deft turn of the heel, he dealt the door a kick
which effectually closed it in the murderous face of
the halting and hesitating Keller.</p>

<p>June, shuddering in every vein, clung to her protector.</p>

<p>“Gawd-love-us-all!” Cries and commotion arose from
the table, yet almost at once the imperious voice soared
above the din. “Set her down, can’t yer, Elbert?
Didn’t yer see that bloke?”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;I did,” said Elbert, stolidly pressing his queer
armful into a chair near the fire.</p>

<p>“Better git after him lively,” said the voice at the
table. “He’s the one as did in Kitty Lewis last week.”</p>

<p>Elbert, a young man six feet tall and proportionately
broad of shoulder, was not however a squire of dames.
With a scared look on a face that even in circumstances
entirely favourable could hardly rank as a thing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
beauty, he moved to the door and slipped a bolt across.
“Not goin’ near the&mdash;&mdash;” he said, sullenly. “Not
goin’ to be mixed up wiv it&mdash;not me.”</p>

<p>The voice at the table, whose owner was addressed
as Maw, proceeded “to tell off” Elbert. He was a
skunk, he was no man, he was a mean swine. In the
sight of Maw, who ran to words as well as flesh, Elbert
was all this and more. She rose majestically, threatening
to “dot him” if he didn’t “’op in,” and she came
to June with an enormous bosom striving to burst
from its anchorage, an apron that had once been white,
and with her entire person exuding an odour peculiar
to those of her sex who drink gin out of a teacup.</p>

<p>Three other people were at the table, and they were
engaged upon a meal of toasted cheese, raw onions and
beer. Of these, two were girls about sixteen, scared,
slatternly and anæmic; the third was a toothless hag
who looked ninety; and as the whole family, headed
by Maw, suddenly crowded round June, the terrified
fugitive, shuddering in the chair by the fire, hardly
knew which of her deliverers was the most repulsive.</p>

<p>June fought with every bit of her strength against
the threat of total collapse that assailed her now. In
the desperate hope of warding off disaster, she gathered
the last broken fragment of will. But nature had
been driven too hard. For the second time within the
space of one terrible hour, she lost the sense of where
she was.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> faces, with one exception, had receded into
the background, when June returned slowly and
painfully to a knowledge of what was happening. Maw
was bending over her, and holding a cracked cup to
her lips, and also “telling off” the others with a force
and a scope of language that added not a little to
June’s fear.</p>

<p>Perhaps the smell of its contents had quite as much
effect upon the sufferer as the cup’s restorative powers.
It was so distasteful to one who had been taught to
shun all forms of alcohol, that a sheer disgust helped
to bring her round.</p>

<p>At first, however, her mind was hardly more than
a blank. But when, at last, a few links of recognition
floated up into it out of the immediate past and hitched
themselves to this strange present, a shock of new
terror nearly overwhelmed her again. Recollection
was like a knife stab. The Van Roon! The Van
Roon! Where was it? Oh, God&mdash;if she had not got
it after all!</p>

<p>The thought was pain, pure and exquisite. But the
case did not really call for it. She was clutching the
Van Roon convulsively to her breast like a child holds
a doll. As she wakened slowly to this fact her brain
wonderfully cleared.</p>

<p>The mind must be kept alive, if only to defend this
talisman for whose sake she had already suffered so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
outrageously. She did not know where she was, and
the evil presence holding the foul cup to her lips, and
those other evil presences filling the background beyond
gave her an intense apprehension.</p>

<p>Maw, however, in spite of a general air of obscenity,
meant well. It was not easy for this fact to declare
itself through that loud voice and ruthless mien; but
gradually it began to percolate to June’s violated
nerves, and so gave her a fleck of courage to hold on
to that sense of identity which still threatened at the
first moment again to desert her.</p>

<p>“Where was you goin’, deery?”</p>

<p>Rude the tone, but when June’s ear disentangled the
words, she was able to appreciate that they were spoken
in the way of kindness. But if the knowledge brought
a spark of comfort it was quickly dowsed. Where was
she going? To that grim question there was no possible
answer.</p>

<p>“Scared out of her life, poor lamb!” said Maw.
With furtive truculence she announced the fact to the
rather awed spectators who gathered once more about
the sufferer.</p>

<p>“Where you come from?”</p>

<p>June’s only answer was a shiver. The frozen silence
was so full of the uncanny that Maw shook her own
head dismally and tapped it with a grimy finger.</p>

<p>In the view of Maw, for such a calamity there was
only one remedy. Once more the cup was pressed to
June’s lips; once more it was resisted, this time with a
hint of fierceness reassuring to the onlookers, inasmuch
that it implied a return of life.</p>

<p>“Looks respectable,” said the cracked voice of the
crone, who was now at Maw’s elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“Where was you goin’?” demanded Maw again.</p>

<p>June was beyond tears, or she would have shed
them. Now that the facts of the situation in all their
hopelessness were streaming back to her, a feeling of
sheer impotence kept her dumb.</p>

<p>“Off her rocker,” said Elbert gloomily.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>mid</span> the silence which followed Elbert’s remark,
June fought hard to cast her weakness off. She
wanted no longer to die. The recovery of the talisman
inhibited, at least for the time being, that desire.
Acutely aware that the Van Roon was still miraculously
hers, she felt that come what might she must go on.</p>

<p>But her position was hopeless indeed. She dare not
venture out of doors, with a murderous thief waiting
to spring upon her. And if venture she did, there
was nowhere she could go. Besides, had there been
any place of refuge for such a weary bundle of frightened
misery, without money and with a sorry ignorance
of the fog-bound maze of bricks and mortar in which
she was now lost, there would have been no means of
getting to her destination.</p>

<p>At the same time, she had no wish to stay with these
uncouth, ill-looking, evil-smelling people one moment
longer than was necessary. In a curiously intimate
way she was reminded of that grim story Oliver Twist,
which had so powerfully haunted her youth. To her
distorted mind, this squalid interior was a veritable
thieves’ kitchen, the crone a female Fagin, the angel
of the cup, a counterpart of Bill Sikes, and the gloomy,
beetle-browed Elbert a kind of Artful Dodger grown
up. She and her treasure could never be safe in such
a place, yet at the other side of the door nameless
horrors awaited her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>In June’s present state it was far beyond her power
to cope with so dire a problem. Keeping a stony
silence as those faces, devoured by curiosity, pressed
ever closer upon her, she half surrendered to her
weakness again.</p>

<p>Amid the new waves of misery which threatened
to submerge her, she was wrenched fiercely back to
sensibility. The Van Roon was torn by a strong
hand from her grasp. As if a spring had been pressed
in her heart she rose with a little cry. Maw was in
the act of handing the picture to Elbert. “There’s a
label on it, ain’t there?” she said.</p>

<p>Still half stupefied, June clung to the table for support,
while Elbert, who was evidently the family
scholar, read out slowly the name and address that
was written upon the parcel: “Miss Babraham, 39b
Park Lane, W.”</p>

<p>June was hardly in a state just then to grasp the
significance of the words. Her mind was wholly given
up to concern for the treasure which had passed to alien
hands. And yet the words had significance, even for
her, as the mind-process they induced soon began to
reveal.</p>

<p>A locked door of memory, of which she had lost
the key, seemed to glide back. Thoughts of William,
of his friend, the tall, beautiful and distinguished
wearer of the blue crepe de chine, and of Sir Arthur,
her father, came crowding into her brain. And with
them came a perceptible easing of spirit, as if they
had been sped by the kindly hand of that Providence,
of whom she had never been so much in need.</p>

<p>The recognition of this acted upon her like a charm.
Girt by the knowledge that she was not alone in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
world after all, and that friends might be at hand if
only she could reach out to them, her mind began once
more to function.</p>

<p>Even while Maw and Elbert were occupying themselves
with the parcel’s address and its specific importance,
June was fain to inquire of an awaking self
how such magic words came to be there at such a
moment. Casting back to recent events, over which
oblivion had swept, she was able to recall certain
strands in the subtle woof of Fate. Days ago, years
they seemed now, Miss Babraham had sent to William
a picture frame to be restored. The stout brown paper
in which it had been wrapped appealed to June’s thrifty
soul, and she had stowed it away in her box for use
on a future occasion. Her mind’s new, almost dangerous
clarity, enabled her to remember that upon the
paper’s inner side was an old Sotheran, Bookseller,
Piccadilly label which bore the name and address of
Miss Babraham.</p>

<p>The piecing together of this slender chain gave June
the thing she needed most. At this signal manifestation
of what Providence could do, hope revived in her.
If only she could get to Park Lane&mdash;wherever Park
Lane might be!&mdash;to Miss Babraham.</p>

<p>As if in answer to the half-formed wish, Maw’s
dominant voice took up the parable. “Elbert, you’d
better see this lidy as fur as Park Lane.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lbert</span> did not welcome the prospect with open
arms. Nature had not designed him for such a
task. All the same, Maw was imaged clearly in his
mind as one whose word was law.</p>

<p>At the best of times, Elbert’s obedience to that word
was apt to be grudging. And to-night, with murder
lurking outside in the darkness, he was full of a disgusted
reluctance at having to face such a prospect.
Even in circumstances wholly favourable to it, the
countenance of Elbert was not attractive; to June at
this moment it was very much the reverse. She felt
that its owner was not to be trusted an inch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her mind was growing very active. Miss
Babraham’s name and address, that magic omen, was
like an elixir; it quickened the blood, it strengthened
the soul. If only she could bear her treasure to Park
Lane all might yet be well!</p>

<p>Urged by this spur, native wit sprang to her aid.
The first thing to be done was to get clear of present
company. She was haunted still by the likeness to
Fagin’s kitchen; but also there was a recollection of the
fact that a Tube Station was only a few yards along
the street. That was the haven wherein salvation lay.</p>

<p>Pressing hard upon the hope, however, was the dismal
knowledge that only one penny remained in her
pocket. This sum could not take her to Park Lane,
unless that Elysium was close at hand. Alas, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
not at all likely. Her ignorance of London was so great,
moreover, that she would need help to find her way
there; and in the process of obtaining it in her present
state of weakness she might be caught by new perils.
For it was only too likely that Keller was lurking outside
in the fog, waiting to spring upon her and tear
the Van Roon from her grasp at the first chance that
arose.</p>

<p>Beset by such problems, June felt that she was between
the devil and the deep sea. Perhaps the best
thing she could do was to dash along the street to the
Tube, and then put herself in the hands of the nearest
policeman. But even to attempt such a feat was to
run a grave risk.</p>

<p>Elbert, in the meantime, scowling and disgruntled,
was bracing himself under further pressure from Maw
to brave the perils of the night. June felt, however,
that it would be wise not to saddle herself with this
reluctant champion if it could be avoided. To this
end, she was now able to pluck up the spirit to ask what
was the best means of getting to Park Lane.</p>

<p>Maw did not know, but Elbert when appealed to
said that she could take the Tube to Marble Arch, or
she might turn the corner at the end of the street and
pick up a bus in Tottenham Court Road.</p>

<p>How much was the fare? Twopence, Elbert
thought. Alas, June had only a penny. She was painfully
shy about confessing this difficulty, but there was
no help for it.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, Miss. Elbert is goin’ to see
you all the way.” And Maw fixed a savage eye upon
her son.</p>

<p>Much as June would have preferred to forego the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
services of this paladin, Maw’s ferocious glance settled
the matter finally.</p>

<p>“And you’ll carry the pawcel for the lidy,” said
Maw, as Elbert, scowling more darkly than ever turned
up the collar of his overcoat.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Van Roon, at that moment, was in the hand
of Maw. And although June was on fire to
get it back, her natural faculties had the authority to
tell her that undue eagerness would be most unwise.
She must be content to await her chance, yet there
was no saying when that chance would come; for
Maw was careful to hand personally the parcel to
Elbert.</p>

<p>Before June set out on her journey one of the girls
pressed a cup of tea from the family brew upon her.
It was lukewarm and thrice-stewed, but June was able
to drink a little and to feel the better for it. She was
in a high state of tension, all the same, when Elbert
opened the street door, her treasure under his arm,
and she followed close behind him into the darkness.</p>

<p>Surely Keller must be out there in the fog, waiting
to attack them. Her heart beat wildly as she marched
side by side with Elbert along the street towards the
Tube. Distrust of her cavalier was great. Should he
guess the value of the thing he bore, as likely as not
he would play her a trick. But for the moment, at any
rate, this fear was merged in the sharper one of what
was concealed by the fantastic shadow shapes of that
dark thoroughfare. Less than a hundred yards away,
however, was the Tube Station. And to June’s unspeakable
relief they gained its light and publicity without
misadventure. Here, moreover, was her chance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
While Elbert searched his pockets for fourpence to
purchase two tickets for Marble Arch, she insisted on
relieving him of the parcel. Once restored to her care,
she clung to it so tenaciously that the puzzled Elbert
had reluctantly to give up the hope of getting it back
again.</p>

<p>Going down in the lift to the trains, with the surge
of fellow passengers guaranteeing a measure of safety,
June allowed herself to conclude that Elbert, after all,
might be less of a ruffian than he looked. If he had
no graces of mind or mansion, he was yet not without
a sort of rude care for her welfare. By no wish of
his own was he seeing a distressed damsel to her home,
yet the process of doing so, once he grew involved in
it, seemed to minister in some degree to a latent sense
of chivalry. At all events he had a scowl for anyone
whose elbows came too near his charge.</p>

<p>Arriving at Marble Arch in due course, the heroic
Elbert piloted the fugitive out of the station and across
the road into Park Lane. Here, under a street lamp,
they paused a moment to examine the label on the parcel
for the number of the house they sought. Thirty-nine
was the number, and it proved to be not the least
imposing home in that plutocratic thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Elbert accompanied June as far as its doorstep. Before
ringing the bell she said good-bye to her escort
with all the gratitude she could muster, begging him
to give her his name and address, so that she might at
least restore to him the price of her fare. Yet the
squire of dames saw no necessity for this. His scowl
was softened a little by her thanks, but his only answer
was to press the electric button and then, without a
word, to slink abruptly away into the fog.</p>

for the answer to her ring. The stress of events
had buoyed her up, but with Elbert no longer at her
side and the door of a strange house confronting her,
trolls were loose once more in her brain. A fresh
wave of panic surged through her, and again she feared
that she was going to faint.</p>

<p>The prompt opening of the door by a gravely dignified
manservant acted as a strong restorative. June
mustered the force of will to ask if she could see Miss
Babraham. Such a request, made in a nervous and
excited manner, gave pause to the footman, who at
first could not bring himself to invite her into the large
dimly lighted hall. Finally he did so; closed the door
against the fog, and then asked her name with an air
of profound disapproval, which at any other time must
have proved highly embarrassing.</p>

<p>“I’m Miss Gedge,” said June. “From the second-hand
shop in New Cross Street. Miss Babraham’ll
remember me.”</p>

<p>The servant slowly repeated the fragmentary words
in a low voice of cutting emphasis. “I’m afraid,” he
said, while his eye descended to June’s shoes and up
again, “Miss Babraham will not be able to see you to-night.
However, I’ll inquire.”</p>

<p>Superciliously the footman crossed the hall, to discuss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
the matter with an unseen presence in its farthest
shadows. The conference was brief but unsatisfactory,
for a moment later the unseen presence slowly
materialized into the august shape of a butler, who
seemed at once to diminish the footman into a relative
nothingness.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll let me know your business,” said
the butler, in a tone which implied that she could have
no business, at any rate with Miss Babraham, at such
an hour.</p>

<p>June, alas, could not explain the nature of her
errand. These two men were so imposing, so unsympathetic,
so harsh, so frightening that had life itself
depended upon her answers, and in quite a special
degree she now felt that it did, she was yet unequal to
the task of making them effective.</p>

<p>“Miss Babraham cannot see you now,” said the slow-voiced
butler, with an air of terrible finality.</p>

<p>“But I must see her. I simply must,” wildly persisted
June.</p>

<p>“It’s impossible to see her now,” said the butler.</p>

<p>The words caused June to stagger back against the
wall. In answer to her tragic eyes, the butler said
reluctantly: “You had better call again some time to-morrow,
and I’ll send in your name.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I must see her now,” June gasped wildly.</p>

<p>The butler was adamant. “You can’t possibly see
her to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I?” said June, desperately.</p>

<p>“She is going to a ball.”</p>

<p>The words were like a blow. A vista of the fog
outside and of herself wandering with her precious
burden all night long in it homeless, penniless, desolate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
came upon her with unnerving force. “But&mdash;please!&mdash;I
must see her to-night,” she said, with a shudder of
misery.</p>

<p>Faced by the butler’s pitiless air, June felt her slender
hope to be ebbing away. She would be turned
adrift in the night. And what would happen to her
then? She could not walk the streets till daybreak
with the Van Roon under her arm. Already she had
reached the limit of endurance. The dark haze before
her eyes bore witness to the fact that her strength was
almost gone. No matter what the attitude of the butler
towards her she must not think of quitting this place
of refuge unless she was flung out bodily, for her trials
here were nought by comparison with those awaiting
her outside.</p>

<p>June’s defiance was very puzzling to the stern functionary
who quite plainly was at a loss how to deal
with it. But in the midst of these uncertainties the
problem was unexpectedly solved for him. A glamour
of white satin, jewels and fur appeared on the broad
staircase. Miss Babraham descended slowly.</p>

<p>Once more was June upheld by a sense of Providence.
Hope flickered again, a painful, fluctuating gleam. She
sprang forward to intercept this vision of pure beauty,
wildly calling the name “Miss Babraham! Miss Babraham!”</p>

<p>The dazzling creature was startled out of her glowing
self-possession: “Why, who <i>are</i> you?” she cried.</p>

<p>In a gush of strange words, June strove to make
clear that she was the girl from the antique shop in
New Cross Street, and that her uncle, its proprietor,
was a very wicked old man who was trying to steal a
valuable picture that had been given to her. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
pressed the Van Roon upon the astonished Miss Babraham
and besought her to take care of it.</p>

<p>After that, June had only a very dim idea of what
happened. She found herself in a sort of anteroom
without knowing how she got there, with faces of a
surprised curiosity around her. Foremost of these was
the lovely Miss Babraham, a thing of sheer beauty in
her ball-dress, who asked questions to which June could
only give confused replies, and issued orders that she
was not able to follow.</p>

<p>Everything began to grow more and more like a
wild and terrible dream. Other people appeared on the
scene, among whom June was just able to recognize the
tall form of Sir Arthur Babraham. By then, however
she no longer knew what she was doing or saying, for
deep blanks were invading her consciousness; even the
treasure in which her very soul was merged had somehow
slipped from her mental grasp, and like everything
else had ceased to have significance.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> eleven o’clock the next morning, Sir Arthur
Babraham, looking worried and distrait, was
pretending to read the “Times.” If ever a man could
be said to have “been born with a silver spoon in his
mouth” it was this soft-voiced, easy-mannered, kindly
gentleman. The rubs of a hard world had hardly
touched his unflawed surfaces. He sat on committees,
it was true, and played Providence at third or fourth
hand to less happily situated mortals; yet scarcely, if
at all, had he been brought face to face with the stark
realities of life.</p>

<p>It is never too late, however, for some new thing
to occur. The previous evening an experience had
happened to this worthy man; and he could not rid
his mind of the fact that it was disconcerting. On a
table at his elbow was a picture without a frame, and
more than once his eyes strayed from the newspaper
to this object, which at a first glance was so insignificant,
and yet as if cursed with an “obi” it had the
power to dominate him completely.</p>

<p>In the midst of this preoccupation, Laura Babraham
entered the room. She had returned late from
the dance, and this was her first appearance that morning.
Hardly had she saluted her father when her eye
also fell on the picture, and a look of deep anxiety
came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Have you heard anything from the hospital?” she
asked eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“I rang them up half an hour ago,” said Sir Arthur.
“The girl is very ill indeed. I gather from the tone of
the person with whom I talked that the case is pretty
serious.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Laura Babraham, in a low voice. “One
felt sure of that. Never again do I want to see a
human creature in the state that poor thing was in last
night. I’ve been haunted by her ever since.”</p>

<p>“Pretty bad, I must say.” Sir Arthur plucked
sharply at his moustache. “According to the Hospital,
she’s been knocked about and generally ill-used. There
are marks on her throat, and they want my opinion
as to whether they should communicate with the
police.”</p>

<p>“What do you advise, papa?” said Laura, with a
growing concern.</p>

<p>“One doesn’t know what to advise.” Sir Arthur’s
moustache continued to receive harsh treatment. “We
are faced with rather a problem, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“You mean that it will be a matter for the police
if she doesn’t get better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly that. And it may be a matter for
the police if she does get better.”</p>

<p>Laura Babraham agreed; yet even then she did not
see the problem in its full complexity. Sir Arthur,
taking the first step towards her enlightenment, pointed
to the Van Roon: “My dear, beyond any doubt that
is a most precious thing. And, ignoring for the moment
the state in which this young woman turned up
last night, the question we have to ask ourselves is:
What is she doing with it at all? And why was she
ranging the streets alone, in the fog, at that hour?”</p>

<p>“From what one gathered,” said Laura, “the picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
is hers, and her uncle, the old curio man in New Cross
Street, with whom she lives, is determined to steal it.”</p>

<p>“Quite. That’s her story, as far as one can get
at it. But I put it to you, isn’t it far more likely&mdash;prima
facie at any rate&mdash;that the girl is trying to steal
it from the old dealer?”</p>

<p>“I believe the poor thing is speaking the truth,” said
Woman in the person of Miss Laura Babraham.</p>

<p>“You mean, my dear,” said her logical parent, with
a sad little smile, “that you <i>hope</i> she is speaking the
truth. With all my heart I hope so, too, even if it
proves this old man&mdash;Gedge you say his name is&mdash;to be
a terrible scoundrel. One of them certainly is not
playing straight&mdash;but prima facie, as I say&mdash;if we call
in the police, it is almost certain that it is this wretched
girl who will find herself in prison.”</p>

<p>“There I don’t agree, papa,” said Woman staunchly.
“The poor thing says that William the assistant
gave her the picture; and in all the dealings I have had
with William in the course of the past year, he has
been honesty itself.”</p>

<p>Her father shook his head gently. “All very well,
but Master William is the part of the story I like least.
Is it probable, in the first place, that a young man who
almost certainly has no money of his own, would be
able to get possession of such a thing; and, again, assuming
him to be clever enough to do so, is he going to
be such a fool as to give it away to this girl? Let us
look all the facts in the face. To my mind, the more
one thinks of it the more inevitable the plain solution
is.”</p>

<p>“I’m absolutely convinced that William, at any rate,
is honest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>Sir Arthur frowned and opened his cigar case. “And
I for my part am convinced,” he said, with a sigh as
he cut off the end of a Corona, “that our friend
William is a cunning scoundrel, who has been deep
enough to get this young woman to do the dirty work
and run all the risks, because he must know as well as
anybody that a great deal of money is at stake.”</p>

<p>Laura Babraham had a considerable respect for her
father’s judgment, yet she knew the value of her own.
She did not think it was possible to be so deceived;
her dealings with William had left her with the highest
regard for his straightforwardness; if he proved to
be the despicable creature Sir Arthur’s fancy painted
him, never again would she be able to hold an opinion
about anyone. Yet her father’s analysis of the case,
as it presented itself to her clear mind, left her on the
horns of a dilemma. Either this young man was a
fool, or he was a rogue. Beset by two evils, she chose
without hesitation that which to the feminine mind
appeared the less.</p>

<p>“He’s always struck one as rather simple in some
ways and too much under the thumb of the old dealer,
yet he’s really very clever.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur drew mental energy from his Corona.
“Not clever enough to keep honest, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t prejudge him. That wicked old man
is at the back of all.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is just what we have now to find out.”</p>

<p>Laura assented; yet then arose the question as to
the means by which the truth could be won. It was
likely to resolve itself into an affair of William’s word
against the word of his master. Whoever could tell
the more plausible tale would be believed; and William’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
friend saw from the outset that Circumstance
had already weighted the scales heavily against him.
On the face of it, the story as disclosed by the poor
girl who was now in the Hospital, was frankly incredible.</p>

<p>Recollection of the pitiful scene of the previous night
brought to Laura Babraham’s mind her own urgent
duty in the matter. The girl had begged her not on any
account to give up the picture. So long as sense and
coherence remained the unlucky creature had declared
it to be her own lawful property. Laura had solemnly
promised to see justice done, and it behooved her now
to be as good as her word.</p>

<p>“I suppose, papa, you have telephoned already to
Mr. Gedge?”</p>

<p>“The Hospital has, I believe,” said Sir Arthur. “I
particularly asked them to do so. The old fellow must
be very anxious about the girl, and perhaps even more
anxious about his Van Roon.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t say ‘his Van Roon’ before he’s proved
the ownership.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be difficult, I fear.”</p>

<p>“We must make it as difficult for him as we can,”
said the tenacious Laura.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur shook his head. As a man of the world,
he had but scant hope that the mystery would be cleared
up in the way Laura desired.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> Number Forty-six, New Cross Street, the bottom
seemed to have fallen out of the world.
June’s flight with the picture, as soon as it became
known to William, caused him not only intense pain,
but also deep concern. The news was a tragic shock
for which he was quite unprepared; and the behaviour
of his master seemed, if possible, to make it worse.
The old man was distraught. Now that it was no
longer necessary to mask his intentions, prudence
slipped from him like a veil. On his return, baffled
and furious, from Victoria he at once accused William
of being in the plot against him.</p>

<p>William, hurt and astonished, was at a loss. He did
not know all that had happened; he had only the broad
facts to go upon that June had run off with the picture
at an instant’s notice, without a word as to her plans
and leaving no address; and the bitter reproaches of
his master appeared to him the outpourings of a mind
not quite sane.</p>

<p>Such indeed they were. The truth was that upon
one subject S. Gedge Antiques was a little unhinged.
The love of money, an infirmity which had crept upon
him year by year had begun to affect reason itself;
and now that, as it seemed, he had thrown away, by
his own carelessness, the one really big prize of his
career, this dark fact came out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>William, who found it very difficult indeed to think
ill of anyone, could only accept the broad fact that the
picture had meant even more to the old man than he had
supposed; therefore this good fellow was inclined to
pity his master. It was not for a mind such as his,
which took things on trust, to fill in the details of a
tragic episode. He did not look for the wherefore and
the why, yet he was very deeply grieved by what had
occurred.</p>

<p>The old man could not rid his brain of the illusion
that William had connived with June. Under the lash
of an unreasoning rage he did not pause to consider
the improbability of this, nor did he try to attain a
broad view of the whole matter; it was almost as if his
resentment, craving an outlet, must wreak itself upon
the thing near at hand. Yet in the course of a few
hours this dangerous obsession was to bring its own
nemesis.</p>

<p>About twelve o’clock the next day, M. Duponnet
came to fetch the picture. It had been arranged that
Mr. Gedge should present the cheque at the Bank in the
meantime, and if duly approved, as there was every
reason to expect that it would be, the Van Roon should
be handed over at once.</p>

<p>To the Frenchman’s surprise, he was now greeted by
his own cheque, backed by a livid countenance of tragic
exasperation. The treasure had been stolen.</p>

<p>“Stolen!”</p>

<p>The face of S. Gedge Antiques forbade all scepticism.</p>

<p>“When? By whom?”</p>

<p>Mussewer Duponny might well ask by whom! It
had been stolen by the girl who did the housework&mdash;the
old man could not bring himself, in such circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
to speak of her as his niece&mdash;and he had not
the least doubt in his own mind that the youth who
helped him in the business who, at that moment, was
in the next room polishing chairs, had put her wise in
the matter, and was standing in with her.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques, still in a frenzy of frustration,
was hardly able to realize the gravity of this charge.
Had he been in full command of himself, he must have
weighed such a statement very carefully indeed before
it was made. But remorselessly driven by his greed,
he threw discretion to the wind.</p>

<p>The disgruntled purchaser was quick to seize upon
the accusation. To his mind, at least, its import was
clear. Even if the seller did not perceive its full implication,
the buyer of the Van Roon had no difficulty
in doing so.</p>

<p>“We must call in ze police, hein?”</p>

<p>The words brought the old man up short. He proceeded
to take his bearings; to find out, as well as his
rage would let him, just where he stood in the matter.
Certainly the police did not appeal to him at all. It
was not a case for publicity, because the picture was
not his: that was to say, having now reached a point
where the law of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> had become curiously
involved, it might prove exceedingly difficult and
even more inconvenient to establish a title to the Van
Roon. No, he preferred to do without the police.</p>

<p>M. Duponnet, however, unfettered by a sense of restraint,
argued volubly that the police be called in. The
assistant was guilty or he was not guilty; and in any
event it would surely be wise to enlist the help of those
who knew best how to deal with thieves. Nothing
could have exceeded the buyer’s conviction that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
should be done, yet to his chagrin he quite failed to
communicate it to S. Gedge Antiques.</p>

<p>From that moment, a suspicion began to grow up
in the Frenchman’s mind that the seller was not laying
all his cards on the table. Could it be that he was telling
a cock and bull story? According to Mr. Thornton,
who was acting as a go-between, this old man had long
had the name of a shifty customer. Undoubtedly he
looked one this morning. Jules Duponnet had seldom
seen a frontispiece he liked less; and the theory now
gained a footing in his mind that the old fox wanted to
go back on his bargain.</p>

<p>There were two drawbacks, all the same, to M.
Duponnet’s theory. In the first place, as no money
had yet changed hands, it would be quite easy for S.
Gedge Antiques to undo the bargain by a straightforward
means; and further, beyond any shadow of doubt,
the old man was horribly upset by his loss.</p>

<p>“Let us go to ze bureau, Meester Gedge,” he said, as
conviction renewed itself in the light of these facts.</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” cried the old man, whose brain, capable
at times of a surprising vigour, was now furiously
at work.</p>

<p>“But why not?”</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques did not reply immediately, but
at last a dark light broke over the vulpine face. “Why
not, Mussewer Duponny? I’ll tell you. Because I
think there may be a better way of dealing with that
damned young scoundrel yonder.” William’s master
pointed towards the inner room. “Happen the police’ll
need all sorts of information we don’t want to give
them; and my experience is, Mussewer, their methods
are slow and clumsy, and out of date. They may take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
weeks over this job, and long before they are through
with it, the picture will be in America.”</p>

<p>“You may be right, Meester Gedge. But where’s
the ’arm in seeing what they can do?”</p>

<p>With the air of one whose faculties have been braced
by a mental tonic, the old man shook his head decisively.
“Mussewer Duponny,” he said, in a slow voice
which gave weight and value to each word, “I’m thinking
with a little help from yourself and Mr. Thornton I
can deal with this&mdash;this scoundrel much better than
the police.”</p>

<p>“At your sairvice, Meester Gedge,” said Jules Duponnet,
with a dry smile. He could not have been the
man he was, had he remained insensitive to the depth
of cunning which now transfigured the face of the old
dealer. “But for Meester Thornton of course I cannot
spick.”</p>

<p>“You can’t, of course,” said the old fox, briskly.
“But we’ll go right now, and have a word with Mr.
Thornton on the subject.”</p>

<p>Like one in whom a change sudden and mysterious
has been wrought, S. Gedge Antiques stepped through
the house door into the passage, took his hat and coat
from the peg, and his heavy knotted walking stick out
of the rickety umbrella stand, put his head into the
room next door and said, in a harsh tone to the polisher
of chairs, “Boy, I’m going along as far as Mr. Thornton’s,
so you’d better keep an eye on the shop.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> old man, contrary to his practice, was a little
late for the midday meal, and he had a poor
appetite for it. As he tried to eat the cold mutton and
the potato William had baked for him, his thoughts
seemed a long way from his plate. William himself,
who was too full of trouble to give much attention to
food, now saw that the old man’s earlier ferocity,
which had hurt him even more than it had puzzled
him, had yielded to a depth of melancholy that was
hardly less disturbing. But the master’s manner, on
his return from the visit to Mr. Thornton, was far
more in accordance with his nature, at least as William
understood that nature; indeed, his voice had recaptured
the note of pathos which seemed natural to it
whenever the Van Roon was mentioned.</p>

<p>“I ought to tell you, boy,” he said, in a husky tone,
towards the end of the meal, “that it looks as if there’ll
be the dickens to pay over this job. A French detective
from Paris has been here, and he’s coming again this
afternoon to have a word with you.”</p>

<p>“With me, sir?”</p>

<p>The old man, whose eyes were furtively devouring
the face of William, was quick to observe its startled
look. “Yes, boy, you’re the one he wants to see. The
Loov authorities have managed to get wind of this
Van Roon of ours, and they say it’s the feller they’ve
been looking for since 1898.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>Easy to gull William in some respects was, yet, he
could not help thinking that the French Government
took a little too much for granted.</p>

<p>“I think so, too&mdash;but there it is,” said the old man.
“They have to prove the Van Roon is theirs, and that
won’t be easy, as I told the detective this morning. But
I understand that the question of identity turns upon
certain marks, as well as upon similarity of subject.”</p>

<p>William allowed that the subject had an undoubted
similarity with that of the picture stolen from the
Louvre, but then, as he explained, every known Van
Roon had a strong family likeness. In size they varied
little, and they always depicted trees, water, clouds,
and in some cases a windmill.</p>

<p>“Ours, I believe, had no windmill.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, only water and trees, and a wonderful bit
of cloud.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said the old man mournfully, “that
the one that was stolen from the Loov had no windmill.”</p>

<p>“The other one in the Louvre has no windmill; there
are two at Amsterdam that have no windmill; and
there’s one at The Hague, I believe, that hasn’t a windmill.”</p>

<p>“May be. These are all points in our favour. But,
as I say, the whole question will turn upon certain
identification marks, and this French detective is coming
here this afternoon to examine it. So it seems to
me that the best thing you can do is to go off at once,
and get it back from that hussy, because you can take
it from me, boy, that we are going to be held responsible
for the picture’s safety by the French police; and
if when the detective calls again all we have to say is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
that it has vanished like magic, and we are unable to
produce it, we may easily find ourselves in the lock-up.”</p>

<p>This speech, worded with care and uttered with
weight, had the effect of increasing William’s distress.
Underlying it was the clear assumption that he was in
league with June, and this was intolerable to him, less
because of her strangely misguided action, than for the
reason that the master to whom he had been so long
devoted found it impossible to believe his word.</p>

<p>“If only I knew where Miss June was, sir&mdash;” he said,
miserably.</p>

<p>The old man, with the fragment of caution still left
to him, was able to refrain from giving William the lie.
It wasn’t easy to forbear, since he was quite unable
to accept the open and palpable fact that his assistant
was in complete ignorance of June’s whereabouts. So
true it is that the gods first tamper with the reason of
those whom they would destroy!</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques was in the toils of a powerful
and dangerous obsession. He saw William in terms
of himself; indeed, he was overtaken by the nemesis
which dogs the crooked mind. For the old man was
now incapable of seeing things as they were; the
monstrous shadow of his own wickedness and folly
enshrouded others like a pall. One so shrewd as William’s
master, who had had such opportunities, moreover,
of gauging the young man’s worth, should have
been the last person in the world to hold him guilty
of this elaborate and futile deceit; but the old man was
in thrall to the Frankenstein his own evil thoughts had
created.</p>

<p>He was sure that William was lying. Just as in the
first instance the young man had given the picture to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
“the hussy”, he was now in collusion with her in an
audacious attempt to dispose of it. S. Gedge Antiques
was not in a frame of mind to sift, to analyze, to ask
questions; it seemed natural and convenient to embrace
such a theory and, urged by the demon within, he was
now building blindly upon it.</p>

<p>About three o’clock William was engaged in the lumber
room putting derelict pieces of furniture to rights,
when his master came with a long and serious face, and
said that the French detective wanted to see him. William
put on his coat and followed the old man into the
shop where he found two persons awaiting him. With
only one of these was William acquainted. Mr. Thornton
was well known to him by sight, but he had not seen
before the French dealer, M. Duponnet.</p>

<p>With a nice sense of drama on the part of S. Gedge
Antiques the Frenchman was now made known to
William as M. Duplay of the Paris police. Midway
between a snuffle and a groan, the old man, raising his
eyes in the direction of heaven, besought his assistant to
tell Mussewer all that he knew as to the picture’s whereabouts.</p>

<p>William, alas, knew no more than his master; and he
found no difficulty in saying so. He was not believed,
since the old man had had no scruple in the blackening
of his character, and the Frenchman, with a skilful assumption
of the manner of an official, which the others
solemnly played up to, proceeded to threaten the assistant
with the terrors of the law.</p>

<p>The French Government was convinced from the
description, which had been given of the Van Roon by
those who had seen it, that there could be little doubt
it was their long missing property. Such being the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
case, the police were only willing to allow the young
man another twenty-four hours in which to produce it
for examination. If he failed to do that within the
time specified, a warrant would be applied for, and he
might find himself in prison.</p>

<p>In the face of this intimidation, William stuck to
his story. He knew no more than the dead where the
picture was; Miss June, to whom it had been given,
had suddenly disappeared with it the previous night.</p>

<p>“Who is Mees June?” said the Frenchman sharply.</p>

<p>Miss June was the niece of Mr. Gedge.</p>

<p>“And he gave the picture to her?” The disappointed
buyer, who felt that his suspicions in the matter
were being confirmed, looked keenly from the young
man to the old.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said William, with the utmost simplicity.
“I gave it to her myself.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, in which astonishment played its
part, and then Mr. Thornton gravely interposed: “How
do you mean you gave her the picture? It isn’t yours
to give. It is the property of your master.”</p>

<p>“You are forgetting, boy,” said the old man in a
voice in which oil and vinegar were wonderfully mingled,
“that I would not allow my niece to have such
a valuable thing, and that you then made it over to me
to dispose of to the best advantage.”</p>

<p>“I gave it to Miss June,” persisted the young man
simply, “but I told her that, as you had set your heart
upon it, I hoped very much she would let you have it.”</p>

<p>While this odd conversation went on, the two dealers
exchanged glances. Both were greatly puzzled. They
were as one in being a little suspicious of the absolute
bona fides of S. Gedge Antiques. Either this was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
very clumsy method of establishing them, or there was
more behind the picture’s disappearance than met the
eye.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques, whose brain was working at
high pressure, was not slow to read their minds. He
closed the discussion with a brevity which yet was not
lacking altogether in persuasion. “There’s no time,
boy, to go into all that,” he said. “The girl’s gone off
with the picture, and wherever she’s to be found, you
must go right away, and get it back from her, and
bring it here to me, or we may both find ourselves in
the lock-up. That is so, Mussewer Duplay&mdash;what?”
And with a lively gesture the old fox turned to the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>Puzzled that gentleman certainly was, yet he heartily
agreed. If the Van Roon was not produced within the
next four and twenty hours, a warrant would be issued.</p>

<p>“Where is the hussy? That’s what we want to
know,” said the old man. “Tell us what has become
of her.”</p>

<p>Frankly William did not know. He was not believed,
at any rate, by his master who by now was deeper
than ever in the coil of his own crookedness. As for
the two dealers who, between them, had contrived, as
they thought, to acquire one of the world’s treasures
for an absurd sum, they did not know what to think.
The comedy they were performing at the instance of
S. Gedge Antiques was designed to bemuse the assistant,
yet both men had an uneasy feeling at the
back of their minds that master and man were engaged
in a piece of flapdoodle for their private benefit. If so,
the old man was a fool as well as a rogue, and the
young one was a rogue as well as a fool. Scant was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
the comfort to be got out of this reflection. They
seemed very far from the goal on which their hearts
were set; and impatience of such methods was just
beginning to show itself in the bearing of Messrs.
Duponnet and Thornton when the affair took a new
and remarkable turn.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span> tall</span> man, quietly dressed, yet wearing a silk
hat and an eyeglass, with a pleasant air of authority,
came into the shop. For a moment he stood by
the door, a rather cool gazed fixed upon the group of
four; and then, an odd mingling of alertness and caution
in his manner, he advanced to the proprietor.</p>

<p>“May I have a word with you,” said the visitor,
with an air of apology for the benefit of the others
whom he included in a smile which expressed little.</p>

<p>“Certainly you may, Sir Arthur,” said S. Gedge
Antiques, an odd change coming into his tone. Taken
by surprise, the old man had been slow to reckon up
the situation. He was not able to detach himself from
the group, and lead the rather unwelcome visitor out
of earshot before that gentleman had divulged the business
which had brought him there.</p>

<p>“You must be anxious about your niece, Mr. Gedge,”
said Sir Arthur, who saw no need for secrecy.</p>

<p>The old man was very anxious indeed.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard from the Hospital, of course?”</p>

<p>It seemed that the old man had heard nothing; and
Sir Arthur was proceeding to deplore this oversight
on the part of those whom he had asked over the telephone
to communicate with Number Forty-six, New
Cross Street, when William, whose ear had caught the
sinister word ‘Hospital’ could no longer restrain a
painful curiosity.</p>

<p>The young man sprang forward with clasped hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
and shining eyes. “Oh, sir, what has happened to
Miss June?” he cried. “Tell me&mdash;please!”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur, his mission concrete in his mind, brought
a steady eye to bear upon the young man before he
slowly replied: “She has had a mental breakdown, and
we were able to arrange for her to be taken late last
night to St. Jude’s Hospital.” He then turned to the
old man, who had either grasped the news more slowly,
or was less affected by it, and said: “It’s a case for
careful treatment, in the opinion of the doctor who saw
her soon after she arrived at my house, and upon
whose advice she was sent to the Hospital. I am very
sorry now that I did not communicate with you
myself!”</p>

<p>It was the young man, however, as Sir Arthur did
not fail to notice, who seemed really to be troubled by
what had befallen this unfortunate girl. S. Gedge
Antiques, for his part, soon shewed that his inmost
thoughts were centered upon something else.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, sir,” he said, with an excitement
he did not try to conceal, “whether the picture she
took away with her is quite safe?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur looked hard at the old man before he
answered: “Mr. Gedge, the picture is perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” The exclamation of S. Gedge Antiques
was not the less heartfelt for being involuntary.</p>

<p>“And Miss June?” interposed William huskily. “Is
she?... Is she...?” He was too upset to frame
his question.</p>

<p>“She is very ill indeed, I’m afraid,” said Sir Arthur,
in a kind tone, “but she is in the best possible hands.
Anything that can be done for her will be done&mdash;I am
sure you can count upon that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“Is she going to die?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur shook his head. “When I last rang up
the Hospital, I asked that question, but they will not
give an opinion. They prefer not to go beyond the
fact that she is critically ill.”</p>

<p>Tears gathered slowly in William’s eyes. Conscience
was pricking him sharply. Had he not brought
this unlucky picture into the house, such a terrible thing
would not have occurred.</p>

<p>William’s brief talk with the visitor, whose unheralded
appearance upon the scene was by no means
welcome to S. Gedge Antiques, gave his master a much
needed opportunity to decide upon the course of action.
The two dealers knew now that the Van Roon was safe,
but as far as William and Sir Arthur were concerned,
the situation was full of complexity. Much cunning
would be needed to smooth out the tangle; and to this
end, as the old man promptly realized, the first thing
to be done was to induce the Frenchman and his agent
to quit the shop.</p>

<p>“You hear, Mussewer, that the picture is safe,” he
said to the buyer, soapily. “I will go at once and get
it from this gentleman. If you will come in again
to-morrow morning, it shall be ready for you.”</p>

<p>M. Duponnet seemed inclined to await further developments,
but S. Gedge Antiques had no scruples
about dismissing his fellow conspirators. Without
more ado, he ushered both dealers gently but firmly to
the door. This new turn in the game had made
them keenly curious to learn more of the affair, yet
they realized that they were on thin ice themselves,
and the peremptory manner of S. Gedge Antiques enforced
that view. “To-morrow morning, gentlemen&mdash;come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
and see me then!” he said, opening the shop door
determinedly, and waiting for these inconvenient visitors
to pass out.</p>

<p>This task accomplished, the old man had to deal with
one more delicate. He had to remove from the minds
of William and Sir Arthur Babraham all suspicion in
regard to himself. He came to them with his most
sanctimonious air: “I can’t tell you, sir,” he assured
Sir Arthur, “what a relief it is to know that my niece
is in good hands. But I am afraid she is a very wicked
girl.” Then he turned abruptly to William, and said
in a low tone that he wished to have a private conversation
with Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>For once, however, the young man shewed less than
his usual docility. He was most eager to learn all
that had happened to June, and to gain a clue, if possible,
to her strange conduct; besides the painful change
in his master now filled him with distrust.</p>

<p>The shrewd judge of the world and its ways upon
whom the duty had fallen of holding the balance true
was quick to note the reluctance of the younger man;
and even if the nature of the case would compel him
in the end to take the word of the proprietor against
that of the servant, he was influenced already, in spite
of himself, by that open simplicity which had had such
an effect upon his daughter.</p>

<p>“Is there anything, Mr. Gedge, we have to say to one
another, which this young man may not hear?” said
Sir Arthur quietly, and then, as the old dealer did not
immediately reply, he added coolly, “I think not.”
Turning to William he said: “Please stay with us.
There are one or two questions I have to put which I
hope you will be good enough to answer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>This did not suit the book of S. Gedge Antiques,
but he decided to play a bold game. “I’m very much
obliged to you for your kindness in taking care of the
picture,” he said, with a smirk to his visitor. “As you
know, it is a thing of great value. Had anything happened
to it, the loss would have been terrible. Perhaps
you will allow me to go at once and fetch it, for I don’t
mind telling you, sir, that until I get it back again my
mind will not be easy.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur looked narrowly at the face of unpleasant
cunning before him, and then he said very quietly:
“I am sorry to have to tell you, Mr. Gedge, that your
niece claims the picture as her property.”</p>

<p>The old man was prepared for a development
which he had been able to foresee. “I am afraid she
is a very wicked girl,” he said, in the tone of a known
good man whose feelings are deeply wounded. “I ask
you, sir, is it likely that a thing of such immense value
would belong to her?”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur had to agree that it was not, yet remembering
his daughter’s deep conviction on the subject,
he was careful to assert June’s claim.</p>

<p>“Moonshine, I assure you, sir.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur, however, did not regard this as conclusive.
In the light of what had happened he felt
it to be his duty to seek a clear proof of the picture’s
ownership; therefore he now turned to William and
told him that the girl in the Hospital declared that he
had given her the Van Roon. A plain statement of fact
was demanded, and in the face of so direct an appeal
the young man did not hesitate to give one. Originally
the picture was his property, but a week ago he had
given it to his master’s niece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“What have you to say to that, Mr. Gedge?” asked
Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>The heart of William seemed to miss a beat while he
waited painfully for the answer to this question. To
one of his primitive nature, his whole life, past, present
and future seemed to turn upon the old man’s next
words; and a kind of slow agony overcame him, as he
realized what these words were in all their cynical
wickedness.</p>

<p>“The Van Roon is mine, sir,” said S. Gedge Antiques,
in a voice, strong, definite and calm. “It was
bought with my money.”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur fixed upon the stupefied William an interrogating
eye. In his own mind he felt sure that
this must be the fact of the matter, yet it was hard to
believe that a young man who seemed to be openness
itself was deliberately lying. “What do <i>you</i> say?” he
asked gently.</p>

<p>William was too shocked to say anything. His
master took a full advantage of the pause which followed.
“Come, boy,” he said, in a tone of kindly
expostulation, “you know as well as I do that you were
given the money to buy a few things down in Suffolk
in the ordinary way of business on your week’s holiday
and that this little thing was one of your purchases.”</p>

<p>Sadly the young man shook his head. The cold
falsehood was heavier upon him than a blow from the
old man’s fist would have been, yet it roused him to the
point of blunt denial. Quite simply he set forth the
true facts.</p>

<p>“The master gave me twenty pounds to attend a sale
by auction at Loseby Grange, Saxmundham, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
bought things to the value of twenty pounds one and
ninepence.”</p>

<p>In a voice which was a nice mingling of humour and
pathos the old man interposed. “This picture, which
I admit was bought for a song as the saying is, was
among them.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said William, “I bought this picture with
my own money from an old woman in a shop at
Crowdham Market.”</p>

<p>So much for the issue, which now was quite clearly
defined. Sir Arthur, however, could only regret that
the supremely difficult task of keeping the scales of justice
true had developed upon him.</p>

<p>“What did you pay for the picture, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Five shillings,” said William, unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Five shillings!”</p>

<p>“It was as black as night when I bought it, sir, with
a still life, which must have been at least two hundred
years old daubed over it.”</p>

<p>“Black enough, I allow,” said the old man, “but it
can’t alter the fact that the picture’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Let me be quite clear on one point,” said Sir Arthur.
“You maintain, Mr. Gedge, that the picture was bought
at a sale with your money, and this young man declares
it was bought at a shop with his.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said the old man.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to have kept a list of the things that
were bought at the sale?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’m afraid I haven’t one.”</p>

<p>Here, however, the old man’s memory was at fault,
and this material fact William went on to prove. Under
the counter was a file containing a mass of receipted
bills, and from among these the young man was able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
to produce a document which told heavily in his favour.
It was a list of his purchases at Loseby Grange,
carefully written out, with the sum paid opposite each
item, and at the foot of it, immediately beneath the
figures “£20.1.9” was written in a rather shaky but
businesslike hand, “Audited and found correct. S.
Gedge.”</p>

<p>This lucky discovery went some way towards establishing
William’s case. The paper contained no mention
of a picture, other than a print after P. Bartolozzi,
which William took at once from the shop window.
Finished dissembler as he was, the old man could not
conceal the fact that he was shaken, but like a desperate
gambler with a fortune at stake, he hastily changed his
tactics. He began now to pooh-pooh the receipt, and
declared that even if his unfortunate memory had
played him a trick as to where the picture had been
actually bought, it did not affect the contention that it
had been purchased with his money.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Babraham, in his search for the truth,
could not help contrasting the bearing of the claimants.
Avarice was engraved deeply upon the yellow parchment
countenance of S. Gedge Antiques, whereas so
open was the face of William that it went against the
grain to accuse its owner of baseness. In spite, of this,
however, Sir Arthur could not help asking himself
how it had come about that a young man so poor, who
was yet clever enough to pick up such a treasure for a
few shillings had parted with it so lightly.</p>

<p>Upon the answer to that question he felt much
would depend.</p>

<p>“I suppose when you gave this picture away you did
not realize its great value?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, sir, I hardly thought about it
at all in that way. I only saw that it was a very lovely
thing, and Miss June saw that it was a very lovely
thing. She admired it so much that she begged me to
let her buy it.”</p>

<p>“Did you take her money?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. She accepted it as a gift. I asked her not
to let us think of it as money.”</p>

<p>“Could you afford to do that?” Involuntarily the
questioner looked at the young man’s threadbare coat
and shabby trousers, and at once decided that he, of
all people, certainly could not.</p>

<p>William’s answer, accompanied by a baffling smile,
gave pause to the man of the world. “I hope, sir, I
shall always afford the luxury of not setting a price
on beauty.”</p>

<p>The dark saying brought a frown to the face of Mr.
Worldly Wiseman, who said in his slow voice: “But
surely you would not give away a Van Roon to the
first person who asks for it?”</p>

<p>“Why not, sir&mdash;if you happen to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you happen to what?”</p>

<p>“To like the person.”</p>

<p>Although the young man blushed when he made this
confession, such an ingenuousness did his cause no
harm. Sir Arthur Babraham, all the same, was puzzled
more than a little by such an attitude of mind. This
indifference to money was almost uncanny; and yet
as he compared the face of the assistant with that of the
master, the difference was tragic. One suffused with
the light that never was on sea or land, the other dark
as the image of Baal whose shadow was cast half across
the shop.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>oubt</span> was melting in the mind of Sir Arthur
Babraham. He was coming now to a perception
of the truth. To one who lived in the world,
who saw men and things at an obtuse angle, the story
as told by this young man verged upon the incredible
and yet he felt sure it was true. The fellow was an
Original, an unkind critic might even say that he was
a trifle “cracked,” but if this visionary who adored
beauty for its own sake could enact such a piece of
deceit it would be unwise ever to trust one’s judgment
again in regard to one’s fellow creatures. And the
reverse of the medal was shewn just as plainly in the
face of the old dealer.</p>

<p>Man of affairs as Sir Arthur was, however, he knew
better than to take a hasty decision upon what, after
all, might prove to be wrong premises. It was his
clear duty to see justice done in a strange matter, but
he would leave to others the task of enforcing it. Thus
when the old man renewed his demand to be allowed to
go at once to Park Lane and get the picture, he was
met by a refusal which if very polite was also final.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gedge, my daughter holds this picture in trust
for your niece, who I am informed by the Hospital, has
been most cruelly used by somebody. She accepts&mdash;we
both accept&mdash;the story told by your niece as to how
in the first instance she came to possess this most valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
thing, which by the way this young man has been
able to confirm. If you persist in trying to establish
your claim I am afraid you must apply to the law.”</p>

<p>This speech, delivered with judicial weight, was a
bomb-shell. With a gasp the old man realized that the
game was up; yet as soon as the first shock had passed
he could hardly mask his fury. By his own folly the
chance of a lifetime had been thrown away.</p>

<p>As he was now to find, he was bereft of more than
the Van Roon. He had lost the trust and affection of
William. In the first agony of defeat, S. Gedge Antiques
was far from realizing what the fact would mean,
but it was brought home to him poignantly two days
later.</p>

<p>William’s first act, when Sir Arthur had left the
shop, was to go to the Hospital. Here he was received
by a member of its staff who told him that the
patient was too ill to see anyone, and that even if she
recovered, her mind might be permanently affected.
The doctor who discussed the case with the young man
allowed himself this frankness, because he was very
anxious for light to be thrown on it. The girl had
been cruelly knocked about, there were heavy bruises
on her body and marks on her throat which suggested
that she had had to fight for her life; and this was borne
out by the delirium through which she was passing. In
the main it seemed to be inspired by terror of a man
whom she spoke of continually as Uncle Si.</p>

<p>The visitor was questioned closely as to the identity
of the mysterious Uncle Si. He was pressed to say all
that he knew about him, for the Hospital had to consider
whether this was not a matter for the police.</p>

<p>William was shocked and rather terrified by the turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
things had taken. The scales had been torn from his
eyes with a force that left him bewildered. He had
trusted his master in the way he trusted all the world,
and now disillusion had come in a series of flashes
which left him half blind, he felt life could never be
the same. His own world of the higher reality was
after all no more than the paradise of a fool. Perversely
he had shut his eyes to the wickedness of men
and their weak folly and in consequence he now found
himself poised on the lip of a chasm.</p>

<p>Two days after the terrible discovery which had
changed his attitude to life, he told his master that he
was going to leave him. It was a heavy blow. Not
for a moment had such a thing entered the old man’s
calculations. He had got into the habit of regarding
this good simple fellow as having so little mind of his
own that for all practical purposes he was now a part
of himself.</p>

<p>So inconceivable was it to S. Gedge Antiques that
one wedded to him by years of faithful service could
take such a step, that it was hard to believe the young
man meant what he said. He must be joking. But
the wish was the anxious parent of the thought, for
even if the old man’s sight was failing, he was yet able
to see the disdain in the eyes of William.</p>

<p>“I can’t part with you, boy,” he said bleakly.</p>

<p>That, indeed, was the open truth. To part with
this absolutely honest and dependable fellow who had
grown used to his ways, for whom no day’s work was
too long, for whom no task was too exacting, who
was always obliging and cheerful, whose keen young
sight and almost uncanny “nose” for a good thing had
become quite indispensable to one who was no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
the man he had been; for S. Gedge Antiques to lose
this paragon was simply not to be thought of.</p>

<p>“Boy don’t talk foolishly. I’ll raise your wages five
shillings a week from the first of the New Year.”</p>

<p>The old man could not see the look of slow horror
that crept into the eyes of William; yet in spite of his
other infirmity, he did not fail to catch the note of
grim pain in the stifled, “I’ll have to leave you, sir.
I can’t stay here.”</p>

<p>Obtuse the old man was, yet he now perceived the
finality of these broken words. As he realized all they
meant to him, the sharp pain was like the stab of a
knife. William was not merely indispensable. His
master loved him. And he had killed the thing he
loved.</p>

<p>“Boy, I can’t let you go.” Human weakness fell
upon the old man like a shadow; this second blow was
even more terrible than the loss of the Van Roon which
was still a nightmare in his thoughts. “I’m old. I’m
getting deaf and my eyes are going.” He who had had
no spark of pity for others did not scruple to ask it for
himself.</p>

<p>William was a rock. Primitive as he was, now that
he could respect his master no more, he must cease to
serve him. The revelation of that master’s baseness
had stricken him to the heart; for the time being it
had taken the savour out of life itself.</p>

<p>One hope, one frail hope remained to S. Gedge Antiques,
even when he knew at last that his assistant
was “through” with him. In times so difficult the
young man might not be able to get another job; yet
he had only to mention it to discover it was not a staff
on which he would be able to lean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>William, it seemed, had got another job already.</p>

<p>“At how much a week?” Habit was so strong,
there was no concealing the sneer in the tone of surprised
inquiry.</p>

<p>Three pounds a week was to be William’s salary.
The old man could only gasp. It brought home to him,
as perhaps nothing else could have done, the real worth
of the treasure he was about to lose. It was four times
the rate at which he had thought well to reward these
priceless services.</p>

<p>“Who is being fool enough to give you that money?”
he sneered, the ruling passion still strong in him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hutton, sir, at the top of the street,” was the
mournful answer.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques dug a savage tooth in his lower
lip. Joseph Hutton was a young and “pushful” rival
whom on instinct he hated. “Fellow’s a fool to go
spoiling the market,” he snarled.</p>

<p>Alas, the old man knew but too well that as far as
William was concerned, it was not at all a question of
spoiling the market. That aspect of the matter would
never arise in his mind.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">E</span>very</span> day for a fortnight William went to the
Hospital, only to be denied a sight of the patient.
June was fighting for life. And even when the crisis
was passed and it began to appear that the fight would
be successful, she had to face an issue just as critical
and yet more terrible, for the fear remained that she
would lose her reason.</p>

<p>In this time of darkness William was most unhappy.
But as far as he was concerned, events moved quickly.
He said good-bye to his master, removed his belongings
from Number Forty-six, New Cross Street, and entered
the employ of a neighbouring dealer, a man of
far more liberal mind than S. Gedge Antiques; one
who, moreover, well understood the value of such a
servant.</p>

<p>For William, it was a terrible wrench. He was like
a plant whose roots have been torn from the soil. With
the ardour of a simple character he had loved his
master, trusting and believing in him to an extent only
possible to those endowed with rare felicity of nature.
In spite of himself he was now forced to accept the
hard and bitter truth that the old man upon whom he
had lavished affection was not only a miser, but something
worse. When the passion which ruled his life
was fully roused he was tempted to anything.</p>

<p>Life, felt William, could never be the same again.
There was still the beauty of the visible universe, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
pageantry of the seasons to adore; the harmony and
colour of the world’s design might still entrance the
senses of an artist, but not again must he surrender his
being entire to the joy of abounding in these wonders.
It was the duty of every man who dwelt upon the earth,
however humbly, to learn something of the hearts of
others. One could only live apart, it seemed, at one’s
peril.</p>

<p>While in the lower depths and beginning to despair
of seeing June again, he called as usual at the Hospital
one afternoon, to be greeted by the long-hoped-for
news that the patient had taken a turn for the better.
Moreover she had begged to be allowed to see him; and
this permission was now given.</p>

<p>Carrying the daily bunch of flowers, by means of
which June had already recognized his care for her,
he was led along the ward to the bed in which she lay.
The change in her appearance startled him. Little remained
of the whimsical yet high-spirited and practical
girl who had mocked his inefficiency in regard to the
world and its ways. To see those great eyes with the
horror still in them and that meagre face, dead white
amid the snow of its pillows, was to feel a tragic tightening
of the heart.</p>

<p>Tears ran down June’s cheeks at the sight of the
flowers. “I don’t deserve your goodness,” she said.
“You can’t guess how wicked I am.”</p>

<p>As she extended to him her thin arms he found it
hard to rein back his own tears. What suffering he
had unwittingly brought upon this poor thing. But it
was impossible to keep track of her mind which even
now was in the thrall of an awful nightmare. God
knew in what darkness it was still plunged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>Shuddering convulsively at the memories his voice
and his presence brought to her, the words that came
to her lips tore his heart. “Am I struck? Am I like
the Hoodoo? Am I like Uncle Si?”</p>

<p>To him, just then, this wildness was hardly more
than a symptom of a mind deranged. His great distress
did not allow him to pursue its implication, nor
could he understand the nadir of the soul from which it
sprang. Yet many times in the days to follow he was
haunted by those words. They came to him in his
waking hours and often in lieu of sleep at night.</p>

<p>Returning from this short and unhappy interview
to his new home at Number 116, New Cross Street,
he found a surprise in store. A visitor had called to
see him and, at the moment of his arrival, was on the
point of going away.</p>

<p>His late master, looking very grey and frail, had
come to beg him to return. He declared that he was
now too old to carry on alone. Sight and hearing were
growing worse. He had another quarrel with the
char and had been obliged to send her permanently
away, although the truth of the matter was that an
oppressed female had risen at last against his tyranny
and had found a better place.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques was now a figure for pity, but
William, fresh from the lacerating presence of the niece
whom he had so cruelly thrown out of doors, had none
to give.</p>

<p>The whine and snuffle of their last meeting, at whose
remembrance rose the gorge of an honest man, were
no more. Instead of the crocodile tricks were now the
slow tears of a soul in agony. The truth was, this
childless and friendless old man, who in the grip of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
passion that had eaten away his life, had never been
able to spare a thought for his kind, simply could not
do without the one human being he had learned to love.</p>

<p>Their relations, as the old miser had discovered, were
much closer than those of servant and master. William
stood for youth, for the seeing mind, for cheerful, selfless
giving, for life itself. The tones of his voice,
his kindly readiness, his tolerance for an old man’s
megrims; even the sound of this good fellow moving
furniture in the next room and the sense of him about
the place had grown to mean so much that, now they
were withdrawn, all other things grew null.</p>

<p>The old man felt now that he could not go on, and
at any other moment, the force of his appeal might
have touched the gentle nature to whom it was made.
But the stars in their courses fought against S. Gedge
Antiques. He was a figure to move the heart, as he
stood in the shop of a rival dealer, the slow tears staining
his thin cheeks, but William had the shadow of that
other figure upon him. The wreck of youth, of reason
itself, seemed infinitely more tragic than the falling
of the temple upon the priest of Baal whose wickedness
had brought the thing to pass.</p>

<p>William denied his master. And yet hearing him
out to the bitter end, he was unable to withhold a little
pity. All feeling for the old man was dead; the bedside
from which he had just come had finally destroyed the
last spark of his affection, yet being the creature he
was, he could not sit in judgment.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you twice what you are getting now if
you’ll return to me,” said the old man. “As I say, I
can’t go on.” He peered into that face of ever-deepening
distress. “What do you say, boy?” He took the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
hand of the young man in his own, as a father might
take that of a beloved son. “I’ll give you anything&mdash;if
you’ll come back. I haven’t long to live. Return
to-night and I’ll leave you the business. Now what do
you say?”</p>

<p>Had it been human to forgive at such a moment, S.
Gedge Antiques would have been forgiven. But William
could only stand dumb and unresponsive before
the master he had loved.</p>

<p>“I’m a warm man.” The voice of the old dealer
who had made money his god, sank to a whisper becoming
a theme so sacred. “My investments have turned
out well. There’s no saying what I <i>am</i> worth&mdash;but
this I’ll tell you in strict confidence&mdash;I own property.”
The hushed tone was barely audible. “In fact I own
nearly half my own side of this street. Now what do
you say? Promise to come back to me to-night and
I’ll go right now and see my lawyer.”</p>

<p>The young man stood the image of unhappiness.</p>

<p>“Only speak the word and you shall inherit every
stick and stone.”</p>

<p>It was a moment to rend the heart of both, but the
word was not spoken. For the second time that afternoon
William was hard set to rein back his tears; but
he had not the power to yield to this appeal.</p>

<p>Overborne by the knowledge that the hand of Fate
was upon him, S. Gedge Antiques, leaning heavily on
his knotted stick, moved feebly towards the dark street.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>illiam</span> continued his daily visits to the Hospital,
but he was not allowed to see June. Life
itself was no longer in immediate danger, but she had
had a relapse and the doctors were still afraid that
the mental injury would be permanent. Time alone
could prove if such was the case or no, but the mood
induced by the interview with William, and the strange
words she had used to him, which seemed to belong to
some fixed and secret obsession, were not a good sign.</p>

<p>Following his visit there had been a rise of temperature.
And this meant further weakening of a terror-haunted
mind. Even if the need for anxiety was less
acute, full recovery at best would be slow and more than
ever doubtful.</p>

<p>June was still menaced by the shadow when an event
occurred which intensified William’s distress. One
morning, about a week after he had rejected his master’s
last appeal, an inspector of police came to see him.
Neighbours of S. Gedge Antiques had called attention
to the fact that the shop had remained closed for several
days, and as it was known that the old man had
lately been living alone, the circumstance had given
rise to a certain amount of suspicion. William’s name
had been mentioned as lately in his employ and he was
asked to throw what light he could on the mystery.</p>

<p>“The neighbours think we ought to enter the shop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
and see if anything has happened,” said the police inspector.</p>

<p>William thought so too. Remembering the last meeting
with his master, which had left a scar he would
carry to the grave, a kind of prophetic foreknowledge
came to him now of a new development to this tragedy.</p>

<p>It was not convenient just then to leave the shop as
he happened to be in sole charge of it, therefore he was
unable to accompany the inspector down the street.
But half an hour later, on the return of his new employer,
curiosity forced him to put on his hat and go
forth to see if the thing he feared had come to pass.</p>

<p>The police, already, had made an entry of Number
Forty-six. Moreover a knot of people was assembled
about the familiar door, which was half open. Its shutters
were still up, but two constables were guarding the
precincts. William caught the words “Murder&mdash;Suicide&mdash;Robbery”
as he came up with the throng.</p>

<p>In a state of painful excitement, he made his way
to the door.</p>

<p>S. Gedge Antiques, it seemed, had been found lying
dead on the shop floor. The young man wished to pass
in, but the police had instructions to allow no one to
enter. A doctor summoned by telephone, had not yet
come.</p>

<p>William was still discussing the matter, when the
inspector whose acquaintance he had made already,
hearing voices at the door, came from the shop interior
to see if it was the doctor who had at last arrived. He
recognized William at once and invited him in.</p>

<p>Outside was a murky November day, but with the
windows still shuttered, it was necessary for three
rather ineffectual gas-jets to be lit in the shop. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
light they gave was weird and fitful, but it sufficed to
enable the young man to see what had occurred.</p>

<p>As yet the body had not been touched. In accordance
with custom in such cases, it had to lie just as it
was until viewed by a doctor, for if moved by unskilful
hands, some possible clue as to the cause of death might
be obliterated.</p>

<p>The old man was lying supine, before the Hoodoo.
One glance at that face, so drawn, so thwarted, and
yet so pitiful in its ghastliness, was enough to convince
William that death had come directly from the hand of
God. With a shiver he recalled the words of a strange
and terrible clairvoyance, of late so often in his ears.
“Am I struck? Am I like Uncle Si? Am I like the
Hoodoo?”</p>

<p>As the old man lay now, in all the starkness of his
soul, with only the essence shewing in that tragic face,
William was overcome by his likeness to the image. It
was as if, at the last, his very nature had gone out to
some false god who had perverted him. That splay-footed
monster, so large of maw, an emblem of bestial
greed, was too plainly a symbol of the mammon of unrighteousness
to which the master had devoted his life.</p>

<p>Consumed by pity, William turned away from a
sight which he was no longer able to bear.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>pring</span> came, and June who had had to fight for
life and then for reason, won slowly to a final
sense of victory. This came to her on a delicious April
day, when the earth waking from its long sleep, was renewed
with the joy of procreation. Her own nature,
which had passed through so many months of darkness,
was quickened to response in this magic hour.</p>

<p>The force of the emotion owed much, no doubt, to
the spirit of environment. Life had begun again for
June under conditions different from any she had
known. Powerful friends had been gained for her by
a singularly romantic story. Of certain things that had
happened she could not bring herself to tell; but when
as much of the truth came out as could be derived from
facts precariously pieced together, she became a real
heroine in the sight of Sir Arthur Babraham and his
daughter.</p>

<p>But for her courage and keen wit a great work of
art might have passed out of the country without anyone
being the wiser. These staunch friends were determined
that justice should be done in the matter, and
kindly folk that they were, did not spare themselves in
the long and difficult task of restoring her to health.</p>

<p>The middle of April saw her installed in the gardener’s
cottage at Homefield in the care of a motherly
and genial housewife. Here she almost dared to be
happy. The phantoms of the long night were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
dispersed at last in an atmosphere of sunny and cordial
well-being.</p>

<p>Miss Babraham, who walked across the park from
the house every morning to see her, had become a sort
of fairy godmother whose mission was to see that she
did not worry about anything. She must give her days
and nights to the duty of getting well. And she was
going to be rich.</p>

<p>Riches, alas, for June, had the fairy godmother but
known, were the fly in the ointment. They could only
arise from one source, and around it must always hover
the black storm clouds. She had no real right to the
money which was coming to her, and although she
had no means apart from it, she felt that she must
never accept a single penny. It was morbidly unpractical
perhaps, but there the feeling was.</p>

<p>When June had been at Homefield about a week,
Miss Babraham found her one morning in the sunny
embrasure of the pleasant little sitting room improving
her mind by a happy return to her favourite “Mill on
the Floss.” In passing out of its mental eclipse, the
angle of June’s vision had shifted a little; her approach
to new phases of experience was rather more
sympathetic than it had been. Before “that” had happened,
she had been inclined, as became a self-respecting
member of the Democracy which is apt to deride
what it does not comprehend, to be a little contemptuous
of “Miss Blue Blood,” a creature born to more than
a fair share of life’s good things. But now that she
knew more about this happy-natured girl, she felt
a tolerance of which, at first, she was just a little
ashamed. Envy was giving place to something else.
Her graces and her air of fine breeding, which June’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
own caste was inclined to resent, were not the obvious
fruits of expensive clothes; in fact, they owed far less
than June had supposed to the length of the purse behind
them.</p>

<p>The kindness, the charm, the sympathy were more
than skin deep. In the first place, no doubt their possessor
had been born under a lucky star; much of her
quality was rooted inevitably in the fact that she was
her father’s daughter yet the invalid could not gainsay
that “Miss Blue Blood” had manners of the heart.
Now that June saw her in her own setting among her
own people this golden truth shone clear. And in the
many talks June had with her good hostess, Mrs.
Chrystal, the wife of Sir Arthur’s head gardener, one
radiant fact rose bright and free: there was none like
Miss Babraham. Her peer was not to be found on the
wide earth.</p>

<p>No doubt there were spots on this sun as there are
spots on other suns, but June agreed that as far as
Miss Babraham was concerned these blemishes were
hidden from mortal eye. And each day gave cogency
to such a view. This morning, for example, the distinguished
visitor was brimming with kindliness. She
talked simply and sincerely, without patronage or frills
upon the subjects in which June was now interested.
She had read <i>all</i> George Eliot and gave as the sum of
her experience that the “Mill on the Floss” was the
story she liked best, although her father preferred
“Adam Bede” or “Silas Marner.”</p>

<p>“Before my illness,” said June, “I was getting to
think that all novels were silly and a waste of time.
But I see now that you can learn a lot about life from
a good one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>She was in a very serious mood. Like most people
who have not the gift of “taking things in their stride”
new orientations were a heavy business. At school, as
a little girl, she had shed many tears over her arithmetic.
The process of mind improvement was not to
be undertaken lightly. She could never be a Miss Babraham,
but her ambition, in the words of her favourite
song, was to be as like her as she was able to be.</p>

<p>Like true poets, however, Miss Babrahams were
born. Such graces came from an inner harmony of
nature. All the best fairies must have flocked to her
christening. One minor gift she had which June allowed
herself to covet, since it might fall within the
scope of common mortals; it was the way in which her
maid arranged her hair. June’s own famous mane,
which indirectly had brought such suffering upon her,
had mercifully been spared; it had not even been
“bobbed,” and with careful tendence might again
achieve its old magnificence. As shyly she confessed
this ambition, which sprang less from vanity than
simple pride in her one “asset,” Miss Babraham assured
her that nothing could be nicer than her own way
of doing it.</p>

<p>From hair and the art of treating it they passed to
other intimate topics; frocks and the hang of them;
the knack of putting things on, in which Miss Babraham’s
gift of style filled June with envy since that, alas,
she would never be able to copy; and above all, her
friend’s wonderful faculty of looking her best on all
occasions.</p>

<p>As the good fairy, after a stay of a full hour, rose
to go, she said, “If to-morrow morning is as fine as this
morning, do you think you could come over to us?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
You know the way. It’s an easy walk of less than half
a mile.”</p>

<p>June was sure she could.</p>

<p>“Please do, if you won’t find it trying. Come about
eleven. And I hope,” said the good fairy, casting
back her charming smile as she was about to pass out
of the sitting-room door, “there may be a pleasant little
surprise for you.”</p>

<p>During the last few weeks June had known in abundance
the agreeably unexpected. And though at intervals
during the rest of the fair spring day, her mind
toyed with this new “surprise,” she was not able to
guess what it was going to be.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LVIII">LVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">E</span>leven</span> o’clock the next morning saw June,
dressed very carefully indeed, before the portals
of the House. She had come well. Excitement had
made her feel quite strong again; moreover she had
been promised a reward for the effort she was making.
Apart from that besides, it was the biggest feat of her
social life, so far, to press the bell of such a noble
door.</p>

<p>The servant who answered it was not too proud to
shew by his air of prompt courtesy that her coming
was anticipated. She was led across a glorious hall&mdash;all
black oak, family portraits, heads of deer and suits
of armour, with an open gallery running round the top,
like a scene on the movies&mdash;up a wide staircase, laid
with a carpet thick and subtle to the tread, along a
corridor into a room of great length whose glass roof
gave a wonderful light. Many pictures hung upon its
walls. June was thrilled at the moment she found herself
in it, for this she felt sure, was the famous Long
Gallery.</p>

<p>The thrill was not confined, however, to the room.
When she entered, June thought it was empty, but a
look round disclosed at the far end a tall young man
in a familiar attitude of rapt absorption. Only one
person since the world began could have been so lost to
the present in sheer force of contemplating a mere
relic of the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>It was a rare bit of contrivance, all the same, on the
part of Miss Babraham. Here, before June, was the
Sawney, raised to his highest power. The fairy godmother
had made a pass with her magic wand and
William the amazing stood before her in the flesh.</p>

<p>He was too far from the door and too rapt in adoration
of the masterpiece at which he was gazing, to have
heard June come in. And so, before he saw her, she
had time to grow nervous and this was a pity. For so
effectively had the mine been sprung that she had need
just now of all her courage.</p>

<p>A good deal of water had recently flowed under the
bridge. It was as if a hundred years had passed since
she had dared to label him a Sawney. He had grown
up and she had grown down. So far away was the
time of their equality, if such a time had ever really
been, that she was just a shade in awe of him now.</p>

<p>Many hours had he spent by her bed. It was perhaps
due to him that she had emerged at last from the chasm
which so long and so grimly threatened to engulf her.
His royal yet gentle nature had a true power of healing.
The look in his eyes, the music of his voice, the
poetry of his thoughts, the charm of his mere presence,
had borne him to a plane far above that of common
people like herself. If Miss Babraham was a fairy
godmother, this young man was surely the true prince.</p>

<p>Beyond anyone she had ever known he had a perception
of those large and deep things of sky and earth,
which alone, as it seemed to her now, made life worth
while. He was the prophet of the beautiful in deed
as in word. During the long night through which she
had passed, the sense of her inferiority had been not
the least of her sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>That sense returned upon her now as she stood timidly
by the door through which she had come, watching
the beams of an April sun, almost as shy as herself,
weave an aureole for him. Here was the god of her
dreams; she who lately had known no god and who
long ago had taught herself to despise all forms of
dreaming.</p>

<p>At last he turned and saw her.</p>

<p>“You!” He sprang towards her with an eager cry.</p>

<p>Brilliant stage management. But by fate’s perversity,
the players, somehow, were not quite equal to
their parts. June’s shy timidity communicated itself
at once to this sensitive plant. There was not a ghost
of a reason why he should not have taken her in his
arms, for he had come to love her tenderly. The act
had been devised for him, the deed expected, but this
young man was less wise in some things than in others.
Deep as he could look into hidden mysteries, there was
certainly one mystery whose heart he could not read.</p>

<p>June’s odd confusion summoned a mistaken chivalry.
Broken in spirit, poor soul, by what she had been
through, she could no longer defend herself; he must
be, therefore, very gentle. It would have been easier
to tackle the Miss June of New Cross Street, the
rather imperious and sharp-tongued niece of his late
employer, than this quivering storm-beaten flower.</p>

<p>With all his genius it was to be feared he would always
be a Sawney.</p>

<p>“How are you getting on Miss June?” he said lamely.
“You look very thin, but you’ve got quite a colour.”</p>

<p>Something of the gawklike New Cross Street manner,
which compared ill with Miss Babraham’s tact and
finesse was in this greeting. Phœbus Apollo took a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
sudden nose-dive. He came, in fact, within an ace
of a crash.</p>

<p>June’s cheeks grew flame-colour. An idiot less
divine would have given her a kiss and have had done
with it, but in some ways he was a shocking dunce.</p>

<p>“I expect you are surprised to see me here, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>She could but stammer that she was very much
surprised.</p>

<p>“Sir Arthur has asked me to re-hang some of these.”
A rather proud wave of the hand towards those august
walls shewed that he was human. “And he has commissioned
me”&mdash;She heard again that dying fall which
always touched her ear with ecstasy&mdash;“to go over this
Jan Vermeer most carefully with warm water and
cotton wool.”</p>

<p>June knitted her brow in order to accompany his
finger in its mystical course.</p>

<p>“A Jan what?” she said, achieving a frown. Had
it been possible at this early stage of convalescence to
achieve a note of reproof, that authentic touch would
not have been lacking.</p>

<p>William’s the blame for a lost opportunity. But life
is full of <i>gaffes</i> on the part of those who ought to know
better. The ability of William was beyond dispute.
Miss Babraham had acclaimed it, whereby she was no
more than the mouthpiece of her father, that famous
connoisseur who said openly that the discoverer of the
Van Roon was a genius. To Sir Arthur it was miraculous
that a tiro should expose the treasure to the view in
a fashion so accomplished. It hardly seemed possible
to remove the burdens of overgrowth laid by time and
the vandal fingers of inferior artists upon that delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
surface without damage to the fabric. Yet experts had
declared the thing to be not a penny the worse for all
the processes it had been through; and on the strength
of this amazing skill, the owner of Homefield had decided
to entrust to those inspired hands, one of his
cherished Vermeers.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>ogether</span> they went round the Long Gallery,
gazing at the treasure on its walls, which to him
meant so much, to her so little. She tried to see it with
his eyes or if this could not be, at least get some clue
to the quality which made quite ordinary looking objects
the things they were.</p>

<p>Who could have believed that an old and dirty thing
which she had heard even Uncle Si describe as a daub,
would turn out to be a fortune? Other fortunes were
here to gaze upon, but why they were so precious would
always be for June a mystery of mysteries. Even with
William’s help it was a subject on which she could
never be really wise. She had now a great desire to
reach out after Culture; the “Mill on the Floss” was
most stimulating to the mind; but just now she felt, in
Blackhampton phrase, that already “she had bitten
off more than she could chew.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the presence of William which had
induced a mood of great complexity. Old unhappy
things were flooding back. And as they walked slowly
round the Gallery, an object at its extreme end suddenly
sprang into view, which brought her up with
an icy gasp. The Hoodoo was grinning at her.</p>

<p>In its new setting the monster was merely grotesque.
Retrieved from the morose interior of Number Forty-six,
New Cross Street, which it had darkened so long
with its malice, it was no longer an active embodiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
of evil. The force of its ugliness was less, yet for
June, in a subtle way, the implication of its presence
was more.</p>

<p>It was as if the Fates were saying to her: “We are
watching you, my girl. This young man, whom now
you dare to love, have you not tricked him out of his
patrimony by your pretended worship of beauty?
Share his ecstasy, if you please, of his Peter This and
his Mathew That, but don’t forget that Our eye is still
upon you. What you have already received you will
long remember, but you may get another dose if you
are not careful.”</p>

<p>Hearing words to this sinister effect in the secret
places of her soul, June could only shiver. William,
now as conscious of the invalid’s frailty as of the imperious
challenge of beauty, led her at once to a seat
without seeking the cause of her distress.</p>

<p>He saw she was still very weak and hastened therefore
to set her down on a chair of the Empire, heedless
of the fact that she was almost cheek by jowl with the
Hoodoo.</p>

<p>“Mustn’t tire yourself,” he said in a voice of rare
sympathy which did but add to the feeling of misery
that crept upon her. “I’m afraid you’ve walked a bit
too far.”</p>

<p>Again June shivered. The old unhappy things were
threatening once more to submerge her. “How I wish
That had not come here,” she said dismally. There
was no need to point at the Image; she was sure that
he knew what she meant.</p>

<p>But amazing young man that he was, this was trying
him a little too highly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean the James,” he said pointing to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
windmill opposite. “He isn’t a Mathew, is he? I’m
so glad, Miss June, you think that too, because with
you to back me, I may be able to break it to Sir
Arthur, that this isn’t quite the place for him.”</p>

<p>Divine humility! Mad confusion! Had she but felt
a little stronger, a little less unhappy, she really could
have shaken him.</p>

<p>“I mean the Hoodoo,” she said woefully.</p>

<p>Her wild bird’s heart went quick and high as she
saw him turn casually and enfold That with a slow
smile. “Right again,” he said, his head a little to one
side in pure connoisseurship, a trick she had learned
to watch for. “I quite agree with you&mdash;the old fool
swallows more than his share of this beautiful light.”</p>

<p>June was not thinking of the beautiful light. She
was trembling in spirit; but one of his nature could
not be expected to know what demons from the abyss
were invading her. “How I wish it was somewhere
else.”</p>

<p>His laugh of gay agreement was suddenly checked
as he caught the look in her eyes and in the next
instant he saw the old man lying dead at the foot of
the Hoodoo.</p>

<p>It was like the passing of a cloud across the sun.
Life for him, also, had found another notation in these
terrible months. He had been through a hard school.
Certain lines in his face were deeper and there were
hollows under his eyes. Never again must he allow the
ideal to run so far ahead of the real. Yet in this harsh
moment the power of his nature kept him up.</p>

<p>He was able to pierce to the true reason for June’s
deadly pallor. It was not wholly due to the fact that
she was still weak or that she had walked too far.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
Trolls even now were in her brain. With his instinct
for healing he must do his utmost to cast them out.</p>

<p>“We’ll try to persuade Miss Babraham to have him
put in the garden.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken the words when the fairy
godmother, accompanied by Sir Arthur Babraham,
entered the Long Gallery.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“S</span>o</span> here you are!”</p>

<p>But the light note of Miss Babraham’s greeting
changed to a quick concern as a feminine eye saw
at a glance that June was looking “done.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t get up, please. I am going to be quite
angry with myself if your walk has made you over-tired.”</p>

<p>June, a new shyness upon her, which the presence
of Sir Arthur made much worse, found it very difficult
to speak.</p>

<p>“I hope you are cultivating a taste for chicken and
new laid eggs,” said the kindly gentleman. “And for
a glass of wine to your meals&mdash;which I always say is
what has made Old England the country she is.”
Finding his jolly laugh was less effective than usual,
he pointed to the Hoodoo in the tactful hope of putting
an embarrassed girl at her ease. “There’s an old friend
I’m sure you recognize.” June’s distress, however,
grew rapidly worse and Sir Arthur made a fresh cast.
“I’m not sure all the same,” he said to William in a
laughing aside, “that the old fellow can be allowed to
stay here. Tell me, what is your candid opinion?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been wondering, sir, if he wouldn’t look
better in the garden.”</p>

<p>Miss Babraham caught gaily at the suggestion.
“The very place for the jar of Knossos. And perhaps
Miss June and Mr. William will plant a myrtle in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>“A myrtle,” said Sir Arthur. “In that chap&mdash;a
myrtle?” He plucked at his moustache and looked
at the laughing Laura. “Why&mdash;pray&mdash;a myrtle?”</p>

<p>“Papa, how dense you are!”</p>

<p>A hit clean and fair, which after a very little thought
Sir Arthur was man enough to own. His one excuse,
and a poor one, was that in certain things the sex to
which he had the misfortune to belong, was notoriously
“slow in the uptake.”</p>

<p>It was now William’s turn to acclaim the idea.
Blushing deeply said that quaint and whimsical young
man: “Yes, Miss Babraham, with your permission we
will plant a myrtle in the jar of Knossos.”</p>

<p>In the laugh which followed June did not share;
just now her feeling was that she would never be able
to laugh again.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur, still tactful, now conceived it to be his
duty to cheer the poor girl up. “By the way,” he said,
“has my daughter told you what we propose to do with
your Van Roon? Of course with your permission.”</p>

<p>June simply longed for the power to say that it was
not for her to give the permission as the Van Roon
was not hers. But she was living just now in a kind of
dream in which action and speech had no part. The
only thing she could do was to listen passively to the
voice of Sir Arthur, while it leisurely unfolded a tale
of fairyland.</p>

<p>“I must tell you,” he said, “subject to your approval&mdash;always,
of course, subject to <i>that</i>&mdash;we have formed a
sort of committee to deal with this picture of yours.
It has given rise to a rather curious position. We think&mdash;three
or four of us&mdash;that it ought to be acquired for
the nation; but of course there’s the question of price.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
If the work is put up at auction, it may fetch more
than we should feel justified in paying. Sentiment of
course; but nowadays sentiment plays a big part in
these matters. On the other hand, having regard to the
obscurity of its origin, it might be knocked down for
considerably less than it is intrinsically worth. All the
same we are quite convinced that it is a very choice
example of a great master, and that the place for it is
the National Gallery, where another Van Roon is badly
needed. Now I hope you see the dilemma. If the
nation enters the market a definite buyer, the thing may
soar to a preposterous sum. At the same time, we
don’t want the nation to acquire it for less than its real
value. So the question in a nutshell is, will you accept
a private arbitration or do you prefer to run the risk of
getting comparatively little in the hope of obtaining an
extra ten thousand pounds or so?”</p>

<p>June followed the argument as closely as she could,
and at the end of it burst into wild tears.</p>

<p>“The picture is not mine,” she sobbed. “It doesn’t
belong to me.”</p>

<p>It was a moment of keen embarrassment. Sir
Arthur, who had doubted from the first, was hardly to
be blamed for beginning to doubt again. Such an
outburst was the oddest confirmation of his first suspicion,
which conspiring Circumstance had enabled him
perhaps too easily to forget. But Laura’s faith was
quite unshaken. For her the question of ownership
had been settled once and for all. The poor thing was
overwrought, overdriven; it was so like the tactless
father of hers, to worry the girl with all kinds of tiresome
details when he should have known that she was
not strong enough to grapple with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>“Come, papa,” said Laura Babraham with reproof in
a clear grey eye. “If we don’t go at once and look at
that herbaceous border we shall certainly be late for
luncheon.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">L</span>eft</span> to themselves once more, it became William’s
task to comfort June’s distress. Like Sir Arthur,
he too, it seemed, could be tactful. Instead of discussing
the question of the Van Roon’s ownership or the
unlucky presence of the Hoodoo, he began gently to
discourse of Mathew Maris.</p>

<p>As far as June was concerned he might as well have
discoursed of the moon. In the first place she had
never heard of Mathew Maris; and in the second she
was consumed by a desire to settle forever the question
of the Van Roon which was now tormenting her like a
fire. This was a dynamic moment, when great decisions
are reached with startling abruptness and half a
lifetime may be lived in half a minute.</p>

<p>Mathew Maris was not for June just now. Suddenly
she broke again into wild sobs.</p>

<p>“I cheated you, I tricked you over that picture.”</p>

<p>Again, good honest fellow, he tried to change the
current of this mind distraught. But it was not to
be.</p>

<p>“You gave it me, didn’t you, because I made you
think I had fallen in love with it? But I hadn’t. It
meant nothing to me&mdash;not in that way.”</p>

<p>He stood an image of dismay, but he had to
listen.</p>

<p>“Why do you suppose I did that? I’ll tell you. I
overheard Uncle Si talking to a dealer. You remember,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
don’t you, the funny crooked little man in the knitted
comforter and the brown billycock whom I used to call
Foxy Face? One morning when you were out he
offered Uncle Si five pounds for it and Uncle Si said
it might be worth a good deal more. That’s why I
decided to get hold of it if I could, before Uncle Si
got it from you. And that’s why I cracked it up and
made you think I could see all sorts of wonders in it,
when all the time I saw no more beauty in it than there
is in That.” And she pointed to the Hoodoo.</p>

<p>William gave a little gasp. June heard the gasp.
And in the mad unhappiness of that moment she determined
to spare herself nothing. She would strip
herself bare so that the whip might be better laid on.</p>

<p>“Beauty means no more to me than it does to that
Thing there. All your talk about Hobbemas and
Marises and Vermeers and Cromes are to me just
sloppy. They bore me stiff every time. I hate the
sight of all these things.” The wave of a wildly
tragic hand included all the masterpieces in the Long
Gallery. “I hate them! I hate them! So now you
know the mean and dirty liar that I am.”</p>

<p>No longer able to bear the sound of her strange and
terrible words he turned sickly away. It was almost
as if they had opened a vein in his heart. He remembered
again the cry that had haunted him after his
seeing her first at the Hospital. “Am I struck? Am I
like Uncle Si? Am I like the Hoodoo?”</p>

<p>Poor soul! It was not for him to judge her. He
could only think of her sufferings. And it was cruel
indeed to realize what they must be now.</p>

<p>“That’s why I don’t want the money. And that’s
why I don’t mean to have it. I burn when I think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
it. Now you know how low down I am. I hope you
like the way I’ve cheated you.”</p>

<p>He sought to take her hand, but she withdrew it
fiercely. His very goodness almost made her hate him.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y</span> the advice of Miss Babraham they planted a
myrtle in the jar of Knossos. Some days later
the Hoodoo was haled into a convenient corner of the
Italian garden. Here, by the marge of a tiny rock-strewn
lake, the momentous rite was performed with a
high solemnity. Much displacement of mould and a
considerable wheelbarrowing of the same was necessary
and Mr. Chrystal, the head gardener, had to advise
in the use of the trowel, an art in which neither
June nor William was quite so adept as they might
have been. But at last, after some honest digging and
shovelling on the part of William who was not afraid
to take off his coat to the job, and timely help from
Mr. Chrystal’s George who was uncannily wise, although
to be sure he had the experience of a lifetime
and a fairly long one to bring to bear on such matters,
the thing was done.</p>

<p>June and William then retired to the fragrant shade
of a budding lime, feeling rather hot, yet not dissatisfied
with their labours. It was a perfect morning.
Larks were hovering in the bright air. Blackbirds and
thrushes were trying out their grace-notes, and once
June thought she heard a nightingale.</p>

<p>For a little they reclined in poetic comfort in two
wicker chairs. Fauns in marble, and Cupid, complete
with bow and arrows lurked hard by. At last June
broke a delicious silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>“You must put your coat on,” she said suddenly.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;” said William who really had delved and
shovelled to some purpose.</p>

<p>June was not to be Butted&mdash;not this golden day.</p>

<p>“If you don’t you might get a bad chill,” she said
severely.</p>

<p>William rose and did her bidding. And in the midst
of that simple act, a certain piece of confidential information,
which Sir Arthur and Miss Laura had been
kind enough to supply at frequent intervals during the
last few days, recurred forcibly to his mind. It was to
the effect that “Miss Gedge was so practical she would
make an ideal wife for an artist.”</p>

<p>As far as the major premise was concerned it was
less irrelevant than at first it might seem, for William
had recently decided that an artist was what he was
going to be. In the very act of putting on his coat
he now recalled the high and sacred mystery to which
his life was vowed. And further he recalled that before
entering the garden he had taken the precaution
of slipping a neat little sketching book and pencil into
his coat pocket. Thus, upon sitting down, in solemn
silence he took them forth and proceeded to draw.</p>

<p>June it was who broke the silence, after some little
while.</p>

<p>“If you are drawing that myrtle,” she said, “it looks
a bit potty to me stuck up there. There’s nothing
to it.”</p>

<p>She was more her true self this happy morning than
for many a tragic month.</p>

<p>“It’ll grow,” said the artist.</p>

<p>“Won’t seem much if it doesn’t in that great jar.
It was Miss Babraham’s idea to stick it there, so it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
all right of course. She said it was an emblem of
what was it?”</p>

<p>“Of marriage,” said the artist with an air of innocent
abstraction.</p>

<p>“Then she ought to have planted it herself&mdash;if she
<i>is</i> going to be married.”</p>

<p>“On the first of July. They’ve fixed the day.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said June. “Have you seen her young man?”</p>

<p>“He came to lunch yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“The Honourable Barrington, a gentleman in the
Blues.”</p>

<p>June frowned portentously. “I hope he’ll be good
enough for her.” But she didn’t sound very hopeful.</p>

<p>“He’s a very nice gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Ought to be if he’s going to marry <i>her</i>. But what
I should like to know is, why was she so set on you and
me planting that myrtle when she ought to have planted
it herself.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know, I’m sure, Miss June,” said the artist,
not so much as glancing up from his work.</p>

<p>Once a Sawney always a Sawney. Perennially, it
seemed, was she up against the relentless workings of
that natural law. Marriage, money, commonsense, the
really big things of life, meant so little to him compared
with windmills and myrtles, and things of that kind.
Like her beloved Miss Babraham, this dear and charming
fellow was almost too good to be true, but day by
day the conviction was growing upon her that he really
did need somebody practical to look after him. And
she was not alone in thinking so. Miss Babraham,
who knew so much about everything, had already expressed
that opinion to her quite strongly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>Here he was, in the middle of a perfect morning,
with all sorts of really beautiful things about him, and
larks and blackbirds quiring, and the sun on the water
and the Surrey hills, wasting his time seemingly, by
drawing that rather paltry looking little plant stuck up
there on the top of the Hoodoo. Even if it was the
emblem of marriage she could not help a subtle feeling
of annoyance that he should not use his precious time a
bit better.</p>

<p>However, the cream of the joke was to follow.</p>

<p>The artist it was who quaintly burst this fresh bubble
of silence. “Talk as much as you like, Miss June,” he
said with something a little odd, a little unexpected in
his manner, “but I hope you’ll keep your hands in your
lap just as they are now, and if you don’t mind will
you please bring your chin round a bit&mdash;on to a level
with my finger.”</p>

<p>“Please get on with that myrtle.” Before, however,
the fiat was really pronounced, she abruptly stopped.
Could such a thing be? Was it possible that he was
not drawing the myrtle at all?</p>

<p>It was more than possible.</p>

<p>And that was the cream of the whole matter!</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“I</span>’m</span> not half as good looking as that,” said June.</p>

<p>“All depends, don’t you know, on the angle
at which one happens to get you,” said William.</p>

<p>It was the tone of a gentleman in the Blues speaking
to Miss Babraham. Yet it came so pat and so natural
from the lips of an artist, that in spite of herself, June
could not help being a little awed by it. She didn’t
agree, yet she didn’t disagree; that is to say, as Miss
Babraham would have done, she agreed to disagree
without contradicting the artist flatly.</p>

<p>Besides it is the whole duty of an artist to know just
how people look in all circumstances. Everybody looks
better at some moments than at others. June had no
pretensions to be considered an artist herself, but at
that moment she knew just how William looked. In
his new suit, neat rather than smart and smart rather
than neat&mdash;all depends don’t you know on the angle
at which one happened to get it!&mdash;with his mop of fair
hair brushed away from his fine forehead, and his
yellow tie, and the curves of that sensitive mouth, and
those wonderful eyes and those slim fingers, he looked
fitted by nature to marry a real lady. Indeed, in the
course of the last few days, a suspicion had crossed
June’s mind that Miss Babraham thought so too; thus
the apparition of the Honourable Barrington and the
definite fixing of the day had taken a load off her
mind.</p>

<p>For all that other loads were still upon it. Since her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
nerve-storm in the Long Gallery a week had passed.
She was feeling much better now, day by day she was
growing stronger; nevertheless she was troubled about
many things.</p>

<p>Foremost of these was the question so vital to a
practical mind, of ways and means. They both had
to live. And if William had really made up his mind
to be an artist, he would need money and plenty of
it for leisure and study and foreign travel. She was
rather glad, if only for this reason, that he had been
able to take such a bold decision. He would be the
more likely to accept that which really belonged to
him: the price of the Van Roon.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur had now informed her that the sum the
committee proposed to offer for the Van Roon could
be invested to produce a thousand a year free of tax,
and he strongly urged its acceptance, as she would be
relieved of all money difficulties for the rest of her
life. To June it sounded fabulous. She knew in her
heart, besides, that she would never be able to take this
income for her own use. Every penny was William’s
and the task now before her was to bring home to
him this fact.</p>

<p>It did not take long to prove to her this morning that
she was attempting the impossible. The thousand a
year, he declared, was hers and nothing would induce
him to touch a penny. Yielding in some ways, in others
as she had discovered already, for all his gentleness
he was a rock.</p>

<p>Desperation now drove June to confess that she had
never intended to take the money. Even at the moment
she had filched the Van Roon from him with her
wicked pretences, at the back of her mind had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
the wish to save him from himself. Always she had
regarded herself as the Van Roon’s trustee, so that he
should not be victimized by the cunning of Uncle Si,
just as Sir Arthur was its trustee now, so that neither
of them should be robbed by the cunning of the world.</p>

<p>She found all too soon, however, that it was vain
to argue with him. What he had given, he had given.
As far as he was concerned, that was the end of the
whole matter.</p>

<p>“Very well then,” said June vexedly, “if you won’t,
you won’t. And I shall present that picture to the
nation in your name, and then you won’t have a penny
to live on and you’ll have to go on working in a shop
all your life for a small wage to make other people
rich, instead of being able to study and travel and make
yourself a great artist.”</p>

<p>She felt sure the half nelson was on him now. Even
he, dreamer that he was, must really bend to the force
of pure reasoning! Beyond a doubt she had got him.
But he was not playing quite fair it seemed. With
one of his little dancing blushes that would have been
deadly in a girl, he was forced to own that he had not
put all his cards on the table.</p>

<p>To June’s sheer amazement he was keeping a little
matter of twelve hundred a year or so up his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Didn’t know you had a rich aunt,” said June
amazedly.</p>

<p>“Not my rich aunt. Your rich uncle.” The odd
creature grew tawnier, more girl-like than ever.</p>

<p>June lacking a clue as yet could only frown. “Come
again. I don’t get you.” It was not the Miss Babraham
idiom, but with her patience giving out and a
new strength and sanity in her veins, she was in danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
of forgetting, just for a moment, that she was an
honoured guest in the most famous Italian garden in
Surrey.</p>

<p>Nevertheless in the very height of the eclipse a light
shone. One of the advantages of a mind really practical
is, that when it turns to financial matters, it works
automatically at very high pressure. June’s brow was
cleft with the harrow of thought. “Do you mean to
say,” she figured slowly out, “that Uncle Si has left
you all his property?”</p>

<p>“His lawyers say so.” The voice of William had
a slight tremor.</p>

<p>“If his lawyers say so it is so,” said June with imperious
finality.</p>

<p>A pause of which a thrush, a blackbird and an entire
orchestra of skylarks took great advantage, came upon
these inheritors in spite of themselves; and then June
pensively remarked, a little in the manner of “Mr.
Leopold” asking the Head Cashier what Consols had
opened at this morning, “he must have bought some
property very lucky.”</p>

<p>Quite simply William stated that such was the fact.
“The lawyers say that in 1895 he bought what they call
a block in New Cross Street, including Number 46,
and that it’s been going up and up ever since, so that
now it’s worth about eight times what he gave for it.”</p>

<p>In sheer incredulity June stared at him. She must
be living in fairyland. And then the sun flamed out
from the merest apology for a cloud which was all the
April sky could boast at that moment and there came
an answering gleam from the burnished image before
her eyes in which they had lately planted a myrtle.</p>

<p>“Much good it did him,” she said with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>William never told June the story of the old man
lying dead before the Hoodoo, nor had he disclosed his
own indirect share in that tragic end. He did not do
so now, for this was not the time to enter into such an
unhappy matter. Yet without coming to details, June
seemed with that power of clairvoyance she had lately
acquired, to divine the whole pitiful business. “Miserable
old miser,” she said in a voice the birds could not
hear. “He must have died like a dog.”</p>

<p>William’s tragic eyes could only be interpreted by
his own heart.</p>

<p>A look so forlorn led June to notice the new lines
in his face and his smouldering depth of eye. “I believe
you were the only living thing he ever cared for,
and yet it used to make my blood boil the way he&mdash;&mdash;”
The anguish in his eyes brought her up short.</p>

<p>In went the sun, as quickly as it had come out.
<i>La Signora Aprile e volubile</i>, in England at any rate,
whatever her mood in more genial climes. June shivered
slightly as if a chill breath in the gentle wind had
touched her. She glanced at the new wrist watch,
whose acceptance William had craved two days before
she left the Hospital. Nearly one o’clock already and
it would never do to shew disrespect to Mrs. Chrystal’s
famous chicken-broth.</p>

<p>They got up together, yet as they did so they felt
that the best of the spring day was fled. Now that the
sun had gone in, the Hoodoo yonder was monarch
once more of all he looked upon.</p>

<p>What a thing life was! Yet by now both were wise
enough not to think too much about it. God knew it
could be ugly, but dwelling upon its complexities only
made them seem worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>Besides there was no time for deep thoughts. It
was six minutes to one. Luncheon at the House, where
William, as became a man of acknowledged genius, was
an honoured guest, was sharp at the hour. The honoured
guest would only just have time to wash his
hands and brush his hair. And so he was not able to
accompany June along the rectangular path which led
from the main avenue direct to Mrs. Chrystal’s.</p>

<p>Moreover she didn’t want him to. She understood
his hurry. Also he understood hers. Besides each
craved a moment, after all, to consider life and just
where they stood in it.</p>

<p>“I have to rest this afternoon,” said June. “And I
suppose you have to get on with the cleaning of the
Mathew Thingamy. But if it’s as fine to-morrow
morning as it has been to-day, let us meet under this
tree about eleven. And then you can put in the last
touches while I read “Pride and Prejudice” by Jane
Austen that Miss Babraham’s lent me. Seems a bit old-fashioned,
but it’s classic of course. I dare say it’ll
improve as it gets better.”</p>

<p>Whereon June took the bypath abruptly, and William,
his six minutes reduced to four, stepped out towards
the House. Life and its complexities did not
get therefore, much of a show at the moment, yet both
of them must have been giving these high matters some
little thought, for as June reached the eucalyptus tree
she halted and half-turned and looked just for one instant
back. And she found that William, now on a
level with the second Cupid on the main gravel, and his
four minutes reduced to three and a quarter, had also
halted, and half-turned to follow her example.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>une</span> always maintained that the Idea was William’s.
He, on the other hand, always maintained that the
Idea was hers. But whatever the truth of the matter
in its centrality, there was really no doubt that it was
Miss Babraham who thought of the car. To her alone
belonged that minor yet still substantial glory. As for
the luncheon basket, although that honour was claimed
for her as well, it may have owed something to Sir
Arthur, for June and William were agreed that the
weighty and practical genius of that man of the world
was visible in this important detail.</p>

<p>It was just after nine on as promising a morning of
early May as the much and justly derided climate of
Britain was able to produce for a signal occasion, when
Mr. Mitchell the chauffeur in his livery of Robin Hood
green, with buff collar and cuffs, arrived at Mrs.
Chrystal’s door with Sir Arthur’s touring car. Inside,
as if to the manner born, sat William in a
fleecy grey ulster which June had no idea he possessed&mdash;and
for that matter it was Sir Arthur who possessed
it&mdash;and almost the last word in hats, which if you happened
to catch its wearer in profile, as June chanced
to do at the moment the car drew up, made him look
uncommonly distinguished.</p>

<p>But so much depends, don’t you know, in these little
matters upon the angle&mdash;etc.</p>

<p>“What time do you expect to be back, Mr. Mitchell?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
asked Mrs. Chrystal from her doorstep, as that hero,
a wisdom-bitten veteran of the Great War, which had
ended before William began&mdash;that is to say Class 1920
was never called up&mdash;ushered June into the chariot
with rare solemnity.</p>

<p>“Back did you say, ma’am?” said Mr. Mitchell closing
the door gently upon the travellers. “There you
have me. We’ve to go as fur as the heart o’ Suffolk
and back again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chrystal knew that. Hence the question.</p>

<p>“Accordin’ to this map,” Mr. Mitchell pointed to
the canvas back of Road Guide Number 6, Series 14,
which was on the vacant seat beside his own, “Crowdham
Market may take a bit o’ findin’. Still if the
roads are all right, I dessay we’ll be home by the risin’
o’ the moon.”</p>

<p>“My reason for asking is that I’m wondering about
the young lady’s supper. However, I’ll expect you
when I see you, because as you say Crowdham Market
may be a funny place to get at.”</p>

<p>In the opinion of June, who heard this conversation,
Mrs. Chrystal was fully justified in thinking so. They
were about to start on a journey to Cloud Cuckoo
Land.</p>

<p>A very romantic journey it was. Up hill and down
dale they went, by devious lanes and unsuspected ways
across a noble sweep of country. Zephyrs played gently
upon their faces; the sun shone, the birds sang; the
smooth-gliding car made little dust and less noise; they
sat side by side; it was a royal progress.</p>

<p>The Idea itself was William’s, June always maintained,
that they should go to Crowdham Market and
find the poor old woman who kept the tumbledown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
shop, where perhaps as much out of pity as anything,
he had given five shillings for the Van Roon. They
could well afford to make her comfortable for life with
an annuity, the precise amount of which Sir Arthur
might be asked to fix if they could not themselves
agree upon it. Indeed the whole question of the Van
Roon’s fabulous proceeds was still vexed. Neither
would move an inch. June still vowed she would not
touch the money. William vowed that he would not
touch it either, but he had gone so far as to suggest that
he should buy the thing back from her with a part of the
property her uncle had left him. To this property he
somehow felt he had no lawful claim; yet by means of
it he would be able to add, free gratis and for nothing,
one masterpiece the more to “his treasure house” in
Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>June, with the frankness for which she was famous,
did not hesitate to denounce the scheme as crazy. Even
the Sir Arthur Babrahams of the world, who were
simply rolling in money, thought twice about giving
fortunes away. What did he suppose was going to
become of his career as an artist if he stripped himself
of the means of pursuing it?</p>

<p>That, of course, was where she had him. And as
they sat side by side on this golden journey to East
Anglia, they divided the forenoon between admiring
the scenery and discussing the problem in all its aspects.</p>

<p>“You talk of France and Spain and Italy.” The
note of scorn was mellowed considerably by the romance
of the occasion. “You talk of studying the pictures
in the Louvre and the Prado and the Uffizi Gallery.”
She had really got to grips with Culture now.
With an indomitable will, an inflexible ambition and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
a brand new course of memory training to help her;
she was not only learning to remember outlandish
words, but how and when and in what order to use
them. “You talk of Rembrandt and Titian and
Velasky, but I’m thinking those foreign landladies’ll
get your size before you can say Knife. My opinion
is you’ll need somebody <i>always</i> with you to see that
they don’t take it off you.”</p>

<p>“Take what off me, Miss June?” inquired His
Innocence.</p>

<p>There was a question!</p>

<p>“Your pram, of course, your teddy bear, and your
feeding bottle.” She added the opprobrious term “You
Gaby!” not however for the ear of this Dreamer, but
for the benefit of the pleasant town of Malden, on
whose outskirts they were already.</p>

<p>“When you get to Paris and find yourself in the
Prado studying Paul Very-uneasy, you’ll be lucky if
you get away with as much as a bootlace. Mr. Boultby
used to say French landladies were awful.”</p>

<p>“Did he,” said the Dreamer; and then with a sudden
animation: “Do you see that water wagtail on the lip
of that pool?”</p>

<p>June pointedly ignored the water wagtail.</p>

<p>“You ought to have somebody to look after you
when you go to Paris&mdash;somebody who understands
the value of money.”</p>

<p>“The less value money has for an artist the better,”
said William the sententious.</p>

<p>“Mr. Boultby would call that poppycock,” said June,
equally sententious.</p>

<p>What William really meant to say was that the less
an artist thought about money the better for his art,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
that an artist painted better for love than for filthy
lucre and so on, that the great masters were born poor
as a rule and often died poor and that nothing was so
likely as money to distract the mind from the quest
of beauty.</p>

<p>These, to be sure, were not his exact words. His
thoughts were clothed more neatly in the William way.
But such was the sum and substance of what they came
down to, and June was so pained by his line of argument
that the contents of the luncheon basket on the
opposite seat were needed to sustain her.</p>

<p>After patiently reasoning with such wrong-headedness,
she looked at her watch and found it was one
o’clock. As there was never a sign at present of
Crowdham Market, they decided to begin on what the
gods had provided. Egg and tomato sandwiches were
at the top of the basket with a layer of ham underneath,
and below that a most authentic cake with
almonds in it; all of which were delicious.</p>

<p>The meal, if anything, was even better than the
conversation, though that also was on an extremely
high level. They were very honourable in their dealings
with the luncheon basket. Share and share alike
was the order of the day, with a third share of everything
religiously laid by for Mr. Mitchell whenever he
might feel justified in slowing up to eat it. Even a
full third of the basket’s crowning glory was laid by
for Mr. Mitchell&mdash;to wit, a large vacuum flask of
coffee, piping hot.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes after two when they reached
Crowdham Market and drew up at the Unicorn Inn.
Here, six months ago, William had discussed the great
drought with Miss Ferris, the landlady’s daughter, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
of those high-coloured girls who June could see at a
glance was a minx.</p>

<p>Promising to be back in an hour, which was all that
Mr. Mitchell could allow if they were to be home before
the rising of the moon, June and William, feeling more
romantic than ever before in their lives, set out on a
pilgrimage up the High Street. It was the only street
in the town which aspired to a sense of importance;
the point in fact towards which all meaner streets converged.
One of these it was they had now to find.</p>

<p>Alas, from the outset there was a grave doubt in the
mind of William in the matter of his bearings. To the
best of his recollection the old woman’s shop was either
the second or third turning up, then to the left, then
across, and then to the left again into an obscure alley
of which he had forgotten the name. That was like
him. In June’s private opinion, it was also like him,
although <i>lèse-majesté</i> of course, to let him know it, to
take her to look for a serendipity shop in a bottle of
hay.</p>

<p>William knew neither the name of the old woman,
nor the byway that had contained her, and in the
course of half an hour’s meandering it grew clear to
the practical mind of June that she was in serious
danger of having to go without her annuity. Having
come so far it would be humiliating to return with a
tale of total defeat; yet up till now these emotions had
been held in check by the romance of the case.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell’s hour was all but sped, when William
stopped abruptly. Light had come. He had hit the
trail.</p>

<p>At the corner of the lane into which for the third
time they had penetrated, was an enticing little shop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
called Middleton’s Dairy. The sight of it brought back
to William’s mind a recollection. Immediately the picture
had been acquired, he went into that shop to get
a bun and a glass of milk. Pausing a moment to
wrestle with his sense of locality, he gazed down the
street. The old woman’s store would be just opposite.</p>

<p>Only a glance was needed to show that the old
woman’s store was not just opposite. The housebreakers
had been recently at work and the decrepit block
of which her premises formed a part was razed to the
ground.</p>

<p>Faced by the problem of what had happened to the
old woman the only thing now was to enter Middleton’s
Dairy and enquire. They were cordially received
by a girl who in June’s opinion showed too many teeth
when she smiled to be really good looking; who, also,
in June’s opinion, wore corsets that didn’t suit her
figure, and whose hair would have looked better had
it been bobbed.</p>

<p>Like Miss Ferris, the landlady’s daughter, this girl
seemed to remember William quite well, which was
rather odd June felt, since he had only been once in
the town previously and then for but a few hours. The
inference to be drawn from the fact was that William
was William, and that in an outlandish one-horse place
like Crowdham Market, young men of his quality were
necessarily at a premium.</p>

<p>But at the moment that was neither here nor there.
And with equal truth the formula applied to the old
woman. However, in regard to her it seemed, they
were now in the way of getting information.</p>

<p>After William, with a certain particularity had described
the old creature and her shop to the girl who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
kept on showing her teeth while he did so, he was informed
that she was known among the neighbours as
Mother Stark. And the poor old thing, the girl understood,
had been turned out of house and home because
she could no longer pay her rates and taxes.</p>

<p>“Half her side of the Lane’s pulled down,” said
June, who now came into the conversation on a note
of slight asperity.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Miss Smiler, to William rather than
to June, “the site has been bought by a company.”</p>

<p>“Putting a museum on it I suppose,” said June.</p>

<p>“No, not a museum,” said Miss Smiler in a level
voice ignoring June’s irony either because she did not
see it, or because she did, which in any case perhaps
was just as well for her.</p>

<p>“A chicken run?” June surmised with a disdainful
eye upon a nice basket of new laid eggs, five for a
shilling.</p>

<p>No, the site had not been acquired for a chicken run.
Miss Smiler understood they were going to build a
picture house.</p>

<p>June gazed solemnly at William. And her gaze was
frankly and faithfully returned. A picture house on
the spot where a Van Roon had lain hidden and unknown
for who knew how many years!</p>

<p>What a world it was! Could Mother Stark but have
guessed she would not have needed a Company to take
over her premises.</p>

<p>“What’s become of her? Can you tell us?” said
June.</p>

<p>“Had to go to the Workhouse, I believe, poor soul,”
said the girl, who had a good heart.</p>

<p>June looked at William. William looked at June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>“Is the Workhouse far from here&mdash;please can you
tell us?” It was William who asked the question.</p>

<p>The Workhouse, it seemed, was not far. In fact
it was quite near. To get there you had only to go to
the end of the lane, turn to the left, cross the recreation
ground and the footbridge over the canal, and keep on
bearing to the left and you couldn’t miss it.</p>

<p>“Will it take long?” The question was June’s. And
a glance at her wrist accompanied it.</p>

<p>“Not more than five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much indeed. We are greatly
obliged to you.” William it was who brought the conversation
to a climax with a lift of the hat.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LXV">LXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was only one thing to be done now. Mr.
Mitchell’s hour was up, but there was no help for
it. The Workhouse, as the girl had said&mdash;she might,
in June’s opinion have had a claim to good looks if she
had not suffered from “a rush of teeth to the head”&mdash;was
not more than five minutes away if you followed
her instructions.</p>

<p>As June had the matter in hand, the instructions
were followed to the letter and they arrived at the
Workhouse without delay. But as the pile, dark and
grim, came into view at the far side of the canal, an
odd emotion suddenly brought them up with a round
turn.</p>

<p>A long moment they gazed at the bleak and frowning
thing before their eyes. And then June said with a
laugh, “I’m thinking that’s where you’ll be one day,
if you don’t find someone who isn’t a genius to look
after you.”</p>

<p>The words came from the heart, yet William did
not appear to hear them. “Reminds one,” he murmured
half to himself, “of that little thing of Duclaux’s
called The Poor House.”</p>

<p>June’s puzzlement was revealed by a frown.</p>

<p>“There’s an exhibition of his pictures just now at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
the Bond Street Gallery. Wonderful line. A great
sense of mass effect.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell me,” said June, “there’s beauty in a
thing like that&mdash;in that old Workhouse?”</p>

<p>“Duclaux would say so, with that dark cloud cutting
across the gable. And that bend of the Canal in the
foreground is not without value.” He smiled his rare
smile which never had looked so divine. But June was
a little afraid of it now. She kept her eyes the other
way.</p>

<p>“Canal,” she said with brevity. “Not without value.
I should say so. As we say at Blackhampton, ‘where
there’s muck there’s money.’”</p>

<p>She glanced at her wrist again. Another ten minutes
credited now to Mr. Mitchell’s account.</p>

<p>“Duclaux, I suppose, would see it this way.” The
queer fellow stepped back two paces, put up his hand
to shade his eyes and adjust his vision to look at the
Workhouse.</p>

<p>This was Pure Pottiness, the concentrated essence in
tabloid form. However, Miss Babraham had already
impressed upon June the deep truth that genius must
be allowed a margin.</p>

<p>A little faint of heart she rang the bell of the gloomy
and forbidding door. The summons was heeded,
tardily and with reluctance, by its janitor, a surly
male.</p>

<p>“Can we see Mrs. Stark?” asked June.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said the janitor. He must have been deaf
indeed not to have heard the question in its cool clarity.
June repeated it; whereon the keeper of the door looked
her slowly up and down, turning over the name in his
mind as he did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>“Mother Stark she was called,” said June, for his
further enlightenment. “She sold all kinds of old rubbish
at a shop that used to be opposite Middleton’s
Dairy at the top of Love Lane.”</p>

<p>“Mother Stark you say!” Light was coming to the
janitor. “No, you can’t see her.”</p>

<p>“Why not? The matter’s important.”</p>

<p>“She’s been in her grave this two month&mdash;that’s why
not,” said the janitor.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said June; and then after brief commerce with
the eye of William: “Has she any relations or friends?”</p>

<p>The answer was no. Mother Stark had had a parish
burial.</p>

<p>William thanked Diogenes with that courtesy which
was never-failing and inimitable; and then after one
more swift glance at each other, they turned away,
feeling somehow, a little overcome, yet upheld by the
knowledge of being through at last with the matter of
the poor old thing’s annuity.</p>

<p>Returning in their tracks across the canal footbridge,
across the recreation ground, up the lane, past the site
of the new picture house, past Middleton’s Dairy, they
entered the High Street, without haste, in spite of
Mr. Mitchell, and with a gravity new and strange,
as if they both felt now the hand of destiny upon
them.</p>

<p>Heedless of all the Mr. Mitchells in the universe,
they walked very slowly to draw out the last exquisite
drop of a moment of bliss that, no matter what life
had in store, they could never forget. And then for
some mystic reason, June’s brain grew incandescent. It
became a thing of dew and fire. Ideas formed within
it, broke from it, took shape in the ambient air. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
might have been treading the upper spaces of Elysium,
except that no girl’s feet were ever planted more firmly
or more shrewdly upon the pavement of High Street,
Crowdham Market.</p>

<p>Four doors from the Unicorn Inn was the most
fashionable jeweller’s shop in the town, perhaps for
the reason that there was no other; and as they came
level with the window a spark flashed from its depths
and met an instant answer in the eye of June. Nearly
an hour behind the schedule they were now, yet they
lingered one moment more, while June drew William’s
attention to a coincidence. The vital spark it seemed,
owed its being to a gem set in a ring which was almost
a replica of the one worn by Miss Babraham in honor
of its giver, who of course was a gentleman in the
Blues.</p>

<p>“It’s as like Miss Babraham’s engagement ring as
one pea is like another pea,” said June in a soft voice.</p>

<p>In the course of their friendship, William had been
guilty of many silences of a disgraceful impersonality;
and he was now guilty of one more. He glanced at
the ring with a wistful eye, sighed a little, and then
with slow reluctance moved on. June accompanied
him to the very threshold of the Unicorn Inn. And
upon its doorstep of all places, within hearing of the
Office, wherein lurked Miss Ferris, the landlady’s
daughter, he faced about, and then by way of an after-thought,
his head apparently still full of Duclaux, began
to stammer.</p>

<p>“Miss June if I go back and get that ring will you&mdash;will
you promise&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>Miss Ferris was in the Office; the top of her coiffure
was to be seen above the frosted glass. And the Office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
door was wide open; June, therefore, gave her answer
in a very low and gentle voice.</p>

<p>Her answer, for all that, did not lack pith. “If only
you’ll cut out the Miss, I’ll wear it like Miss Babraham&mdash;on
my heart finger.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ack</span> they went to the jeweller’s four doors up.
To the expert eye of William, the ring on inspection
was so little like Miss Babraham’s that he seemed
to have a qualm about buying it. He had a fancy for
moonstones and diamonds, but Crowdham Market’s
only jeweller did not run to these. June was firm, besides,
that the ring in her hand was cheap at nine
guineas, and as no one could call it vulgar, it was
quite good enough.</p>

<p>William was sure it was nothing like good enough.
“But when we get to London, you shall have moonstones
and diamonds.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be lovely,” said June; and a deep thrill ran
in her heart as she realized that her dreams were coming
true.</p>

<p>William took a wad of Bradburys from his breast
pocket. He was now a man of property, with a rent
roll of twelve hundred a year, but even a most careful
counting would not let them muster more than seven.
June, however, as became the lawful owner of an Old
Master, whom to acquire for the nation a committee
had been lately formed, was equal to the occasion.
For she promptly took a wad from the vanity bag
which now graced her travels instead of her mother’s
old purse, and made up the sum.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the jeweller, a man of ripe experience,
had put two and two together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p>“Will you wear it, madam, or will you have it
packed in the box?”</p>

<p>An unconventional question, no doubt, but places
like Crowdham Market are close to nature and get
down to bedrock by short cuts.</p>

<p>“I’ll wear it,” June answered. “And I’ll have the
box as well. It’ll do for my dressing table to keep
pins in.”</p>

<p>The jeweller, one of the old school, bowed to June
as he handed her the box and also the change. And
then, a jeweller with a fine technique, he smiled at
William in a Masonic manner and handed him the
ring.</p>

<p>June, as cool as if she was on parade, removed a
white kid glove from her left hand. “That’s the heart
finger,” she said.</p>

<p>If she blushed a little, the jeweller was too busy
writing out the receipt at the other end of the shop to
be aware of the fact.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hey</span> decided to ask Miss Ferris, the landlady’s
daughter, for a cup of tea, before they set out
on the journey home. June felt she could afford to
take the risk, since by now the situation was well in
hand. Mr. Mitchell raised no objection. Himself an
ampler man for a noble lunch, he had been recounting
tales of Araby and lands of fair renown in the privacy
of the Office. His suit of Robin Hood green and a
certain gallantry of bearing had made considerable impact
in an amazingly short time, not upon Miss
Ferris merely, but upon her widowed mother, the sole
proprietress of the Unicorn Inn, who in the words of
the local manager of the East Anglia and Overtons
Bank “was the warmest woman in Crowdham Market.”</p>

<p>While Mr. Mitchell (Sergeant, R.E., D.C.M. with
clasp), and the widow were in the garden admiring the
early pansies, June and William sat down to tea in the
coffee room. Even there the contiguity of Miss Ferris
had rather a tendency to cramp June’s style. High-coloured
girl, she was a little inclined to take liberties
as she passed around the table. And when June, in
her sweetest and best Miss Babraham manner, asked
if they might have some crab apple jam, she caught the
glint of the ring on June’s heart finger in a way so
direct that she murmured something about having to
look out for her eyesight&mdash;or words equally ill-bred&mdash;and
nearly dropped the tea pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>By the time they got under way and the nose of the
car was set for the pleasant land of Surrey, a doubt
infected the mind of Mr. Mitchell as to whether they
would make Homefield before midnight. Neither
June nor William seemed to care very much whether
they did or whether they didn’t. The car was most
comfortable, the sense of romance hot upon them still,
the presence of each other vital and delicious in their
consciousness. Mile passed upon mile. The endless
spool of road continued to unwind itself, a little wind
breathed gentle nothings, Mr. Mitchell sat four-square
in front, the birds still sang, but the sun was going
down.</p>

<p>Saying very little, they lived never-to-be-forgotten
hours. Now and again William pointed to a bird or a
tree, the fold of a hill, the form of a cloud, the gleam
of a distant water. Yet for the most part the nearness
of each other was all sufficing. June began to nestle
closer; the chill of night came on. Saying less than
ever now, moonstones and diamonds stole upon her
thoughts. She was haunted by a lovely fear that she
could not live up to them. And then softly and more
soft, she began to breathe with a rhythmical rise and
fall, slowly deepening to a faint crescendo that blended
with the motions of the car.</p>

<p>East by west of nowhere came the high moment
when the sun was not, and the moon not yet. Somewhere
over Surrey a star was dancing. Very shyly
and gently he ventured to give her a kiss. She stirred
ever so little. A bird spoke from a brake, a note clear
and wonderful, yet the month was young for the
nightingale. But this was Cloud Cuckoo Land, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
divine country in which the nightingale may be heard
at odd seasons.</p>

<p>Psyche stirred again. With a reverence chaste and
simple he gave her a second kiss, deep and slow. The
solemn sacrament was fire to the soul of an artist. And
then he gave a little gasp. The high gods in his brain
whispered that the moon was coming.</p>

<p>The moon was coming.</p>

<p>Yes, there she was, the sovereign lady! He sat very
still, praying, praying that he might surprise some holy
secret, hidden even from Duclaux.</p>

<p>She was very wonderful to-night. Her loveliness
was more than he could bear. There was a touch of
intimacy in her magic; the country over which she
shone was elfland. He seemed to hear a faint familiar
sound of horns. Or it might have been the swift
gliding of the car.</p>

<p>In the quietness of the spirit’s ecstasy he could have
wept.</p>

<p>Might it be given to Duclaux to see her, lovely lady,
just as he could see her now!</p>

<p>But he mustn’t dare to breathe or the vision would
be forever lost.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
